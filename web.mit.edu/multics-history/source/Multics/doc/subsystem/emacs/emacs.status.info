Major Projects:

012 79.02.06  5 20  F: COBOL mode.  Problem is nobody knows what it
		should do.
011 79.02.05  5 30  F: Have a "tags" (multi-language label-cataloguing)
		package.  No particular problem, just work.
010 79.01.02  6 30  F: Have a completing reader.  Problem is large amount
		of engineering and implementation work, and prerequisite
		of MP 009.
009 79.01.02  8 20  F: Organized cataloguing and argument checking on
		extended commands.  Problem is design.
008 78.12.19  7 35  R: Support underlining on "field-type" video TTY's.
		Same problems as Major Project 007.

007 78.12.19  8 28  R: Support overstriking on printing, TV, and other
		^H-recognizing terminals.  Problem is overhaul of
		redisplay data and control structure, specif. detabbify.
006 78.11.28  9 50  F: Keep buffers in non-PDIR place, optionally, for 
		safety".  Problem is Lisp representation of buffers.
005 78.09.21  9 25  F: Start_up files in some non-Lisp ASCII format.  Problem
		is designing and implementing a robust reader/evaluator
		that gives credible diagnostics.
004 78.09.21  8 20  F: Redesign/reimplement option mechanism.  Problems are
		lack of info on options in autoload files not yet loaded,
		and concomitant lack of error checking.

003 78.09.13  6 15  F: Speedtype improvements.  Problem is lack of save/edit
		ability, bugs in hashing algorithm, integration with native
		Multics Speedtype.
002 78.08.30  8 25  R: Synchronize with or abort output.  Problem is too much
		typeout, waiting for unwanted redisplays.  Difficulties
		are needed MCS features, and inconsistent partial screens.
001 78.08.23  8 30  R: Substantially improve printing terminal redisplay.
		Largest problems are middle-of-line edits, asynchrony
		in deciding what to print, too much typeout.


Other tasks:
001*79.02.06  8  9  CI: Install new Lisp; update macros to use unwind-protect.
		Problems are paperwork, exposure.
002 79.02.06 10 30  D: Finish user documentation (emacs_tutorial.info).
003*79.02.06  4  2  Update Emacs on CISL, incl. vfile.
004*79.02.06  2  5  Support ADDS980 terminal in Arizona.
005*79.02.06  9  2  Upgrade to MCS echo negotiation.  (Yet to debug new
		interrupt synchronization under mcs_echo_neg as well).


Explanations of categories and markings:

* indicates that the bug has been fixed.
Bug categories are:  F - fundamental emacs; CI - command interface;
R - redisplay; PL1 - PL/1 mode; L - Lisp mode; M - Mail/message subsystems;
D - Documentation/auto-doc; T - terminal/network support.


Definitions:

A "bug" is a user-visible deficiency causing unexpected results, loss of
display or data, or useless output or display, or action at variance with the
documentation.  Severity and estimated difficulty are rated on a scale of 1 to
10.  10 is the most urgent and hardest.

A suggestion is a suggested design augmentation or modification that is open
to debate about relative merit;  it is not a bug fix.  Suggestions do not
include missing isolatable sub-subsystems.  Suggestions requiring major
redesign or new implementation are listed under "Major projects", and do not
qualify as suggestions.

A major project is a design/implementation enhancement involving substantial
redesign and reimplementation, or the implementation of an entirely new
subsystem within Emacs.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
