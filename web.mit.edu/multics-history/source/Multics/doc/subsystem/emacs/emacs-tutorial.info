Multics Emacs is an integrated editing, text-preparation, and screen 
management system designed to take advantage of the features of modern display 
terminals to aid in interactive text entry and editing.  In some sense, it is 
an editor: yet a more appropriate description would be a "text processing
subsystem": continuous interaction with text is its mode of operation, not
"editing" via carefully structured "editing requests".

     Although it is possible, and valuable, to use Multics Emacs from a
"printing terminal", i.e., one that uses paper and ink, it is oriented 
towards video terminals, and its usage is best learned on a video terminal,
preferably at 1200 baud or better.

     Sit down at a video terminal logged into Multics.  Invoke Emacs
by typing its name at the command processor:

     emacs

Depending upon the facilities available at your site, Emacs may or may not
ask you:

     What type terminal do you have?


If Emacs poses this question, which it will only ask you once per login
session, as opposed to clearing the screen, type in the name of the type of
terminal that you have.  If you do not know this, ask your Site Support
personnel.  If you type a bad name, Emacs will type out the names of all
terminals it knows how to support, so that you can type the right name.  Or
type "quit" to give up.  Terminate the name of the terminal with a
carriage-return, as you would any Multics input.

     Now Emacs will take several seconds to get started up; it has a lot to 
do at start-up time.  When it has started up, it will clear the screen, and
display the line

     Emacs (Fundamental) - main

at the lower left of the screen.  This line is called the _m_o_d_e _l_i_n_e.
It tells you several things, most important of which is that you are talking to
Emacs, as opposed to the command processor, or some other editor.
"Fundamental" is called the _m_o_d_e.  There are various _m_o_d_e_s
best suited to preparing text, programs in different languages, and other 
tasks.  Fundamental mode is the first and simplest mode.  It has no
specialized features at all.  "main" is the _b_u_f_f_e_r _n_a_m_e.  You can be editing 
many things at once with Emacs, like qedx.  Each separate thing being edited
is edited in a separate "sub-editor" called a _b_u_f_f_e_r. The buffers have names; 
"main" is the name of the buffer you start out in.

     The region between the top of the screen and the mode line is where text 
appears, and where we deal with text.  This area of the screen is called the
_w_i_n_d_o_w.  It will always display 20 or so consecutive lines of the document or 
program you are editing.  The region below the mode line has two areas,
the _p_a_t_h _l_i_n_e and the _m_i_n_i_b_u_f_f_e_r, which we will deal with
later.

     You will note the blinking _c_u_r_s_o_r in the upper-left-hand corner
of the screen.  The cursor may be a blinking underline on some terminals, or 
a blinking or solid box on others.  The cursor is always on some position on 
the screen.   The cursor is the single most important object in Emacs:
we must familiarize ourselves with it, and must always concern ourselves with 
its whereabouts on the screen.  All "action" happens at the cursor: all text
we enter is entered "at" the cursor (and the cursor moves), and text we delete
is deleted at the cursor, as well.

     Now we are going to enter some text.  We do not have to tell Emacs that 
we are going to type.  There is no "input mode" or "edit mode": we just type.
Type these words on the terminal, do _n_o_t end it with a carriage return, line
feed or other special character, the period should be the last character you 
type:

     This is sample text.

You will note that you do not see what you have typed immediately, but
soon after you start typing, the text on the screen will "catch up" with you.
This is because you have waited a few minutes since the last time you typed,
and Multics has "forgotten" about you temporarily.  In general, you may see 
what you type as soon as you type it, or sometimes a little later, depending
on the load on Multics.  This is very different than other Multics programs;
other programs rely on the terminal to type out what you type in, but Emacs
must type it out for you.

     You will also note a little star come on under the word "Emacs": this
is called the "modified" star.  When it is there, it means that the
text in your buffer is different than the text you read in, if any, or
is new text (as is the case here), and hasn't been written out to a file.
When the "modified" star is on, you know that you wil have to write your text
out before exiting Emacs.

     You will see the text you typed at the top of the screen.  It just 
appeared there as you typed it.  You did not have to issue a "print request":
The line you are looking at at the top of the screen is the beginning of your 
document: you are looking at your document, not an "input line", or an 
"output line" or a "printout".  At all times, you are looking at your 
document.

     Look at the screen. You will see the cursor to the right of the period
in the sentence "This is sample text".  You should begin to think "We are
to the right of the period on that line."  At all times, the person using 
Emacs must think of himself or herself "at" some point in his or her document,
that "point" being indicated on the screen by the cursor.

     Now let us add another line.  Type the "carriage return" key on your 
terminal to end this line and start another one.  "Carriage return" is a 
character, just like "T", "h", "i", or "s", or a space.  Typing it will
put a "carriage return" character into your text, and move the cursor to 
_b_e_y_o_n_d the carriage-return character, which is to say, the beginning of the 
next line.   Having entered the carriage return, type:

     Here is more text yet.

Again, the text appears on the screen as we type it.  The line we had typed 
earlier stays where it is, we now have a two-line document.  Using what we 
know already, we can type in a whole document!  It is just like using a 
typewriter.

     This is fine, until we make an error.  We have to fix errors as we note 
them.  Let us type a line with an error in it on purpose.  Go to the next 
line, by typing a carriage return, and type:

Multix


We have made an error.  The "x" in "Multics" should have been a "cs".  What 
do we normally do in Multics if we type a wrong letter?  We use #, the _e_r_a_s_e 
_c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r.  The same is true in Emacs, but watch what happens.  Type the "#"
(pound sign, or number sign) character.  Observe that the "x" in "Multix"
physically disappears off the screen, leaving no trace of itself or the pound 
sign!  The character has been erased; our document is on the screen.  The "x" 
is no longer in our document.  What is more, there is no trace or record of 
the mistake we made, or what we did to correct it.  The document is correct
on the screen, as always.  Now, to put in the c and the s, just type the c 
and type the s, and the word "Multics" will appear correct.

     We can continue in this fashion, entering text just by typing it, ending
lines with carriage returns when we want to go on to the next line, until our
whole document is entered, correcting mistakes with #, but soon we may find
a need to change, or modify, some text we had already entered.  For example,
let us change the line we entered that said:

     This is sample text.

to say:

     This is some sample text.

adding the word "some" after the word "is".  The way we do this in Emacs is to
"go" to the place in the text after the word "is", to _m_o_v_e or _p_o_s_i_t_i_o_n 
ourselves there, by moving the cursor there.  We want to go up two lines and
over a few characters.  First, let us "get to" the right line.  We will go there
one line at a time.  We will tell Emacs "Go to the previous line".

     Look on your keyboard for a key labelled "CTL", "CTRL", "CONTROL", 
"CNTRL", or the like.  This is a very important key for Emacs; it is called the
_c_o_n_t_r_o_l key.  It is like a shift key: you hold it down, and while holding it 
down, you type one or more normal characters.  Like a shift key, pressing it 
and releasing it has no effect.  When you press the "p" key (DON'T do it now),
you get a lower-case "P".  If you press the "p" key while holding the "SHIFT"
key, you get an upper-case "P".  If you press the "p" key while holding the
"CONTROL" key, you get something called a "Control P".  It is a different
_v_a_r_i_e_t_y of P, just like p and P, except instead of being an upper case
letter or a lower case letter, it is a called a "control character". All
control characters are commands to Emacs.  You have seen what happens
when you type normal upper and lower case characters; they go into the
document.  Control characters are used to control Emacs, to manipulate the 
cursor and manipulate text.

     To make Emacs move the cursor to the P_revious line, we use the control
character "Control P", the P_ being for P__r_e_v_i_o_u_s. Do so: hold down the
"CONTROL" key, like a shift key, and press the "P" key, while still holding
the "CONTROL" key, then release both. Now watch the screen: you will observe 
that the cursor will indeed move up to the previous line, to a place right 
above where it had been.  This happens as soon as we type the Control P,
we do not have to type (and must not type!) a carriage-return or other
character to make it happen.  Note also that when we type Control P,
we do not "see" our command anyplace on the screen, all we see is what it did.
This is a very important principle in Emacs: what you see on the screen is 
what you have in your document, and it does not matter what you used to 
achieve that state.

     Now let us go up one more line, to the first line. Hold down the control
key again, and press "P" while holding it.  Again, the cursor will jump up
a line.

     Now that we are on the correct line for the change we wish to make, we can
move around on that line to get to the correct place.  We can move 
_b_a_c_k_w_a_r_d_s on that line by telling Emacs to "go backwards": as you guessed, 
this is done with a "Control B", B_ for B_ackwards.  Hold down the control key.
Now, slowly, press the "B" key, while still holding the control key, eight or
nine times.  You will see the cursor move backwards, that is, to the left,
one position for each time you press the "B" key.  Soon you will reach the 
beginning of the line, at which time, you cannot go any further back, because
that is the beginning of your text.  Emacs will cause your terminal to beep 
at you, to indicate that you have made an error. Wait for all the beeping to
finish, and release the control key.

     We now want to move forward to the place after the word "is", in order
to insert the word "some".  Hold down the control key, and type the letter
"F" several times.  "Control F" is the Emacs command for "forward", i.e.,
move the cursor forward one character.  While still holding down the control 
key, type F's until the cursor is under (or covering, on some terminals), the
letter "s" of the word "sample".  If you type the Control F too many times,
simply type Control B's until you get to the right place.  What you  are 
doing now is the most important form of interaction with Emacs- issue commands
until you are "at the right place", or "the right thing has happened", doing
one command at a time and observing its effect, and repeating that process 
until you have achieved what you want.  This is _i_n_t_e_r_a_c_t_i_v_e editing, as 
opposed to counting the number of lines or characters, etc., and issuing 
commands to move  15 lines and 4 characters, etc. (although you can do this 
too in Emacs if you really need to).  Visual feedback is the most important
single feature of Emacs.

     Now we are at the "s" of sample, and we wish to put the word "some"
right there (i.e., at the cursor).  That is trivial: simply type the four 
letters s, o, m, and e.  You will watch Emacs move the rest of the line over
and you now have on that line:

    This is somesample text.

with the cursor still under the "s" of "sample".  Immediately, we perceive a 
problem: there is no space  between "some" and "sample".  We did not enter a 
space, this is exactly what we told Emacs to do.  Let us enter a space: 
simply hit the space bar. Now we have:

     This is some sample text.

with the cursor still under the "s" of "sample".  We have now fixed the
text we wished to.  Note that in order to type in the new word, "some", we did
not have to say anything special, we just moved the cursor to the right 
place, and started typing.  Whenever we type a non-control character (other 
than #, @, and \), it goes into the text at the cursor, and moves the cursor 
over one to the right.  If you think for a little while, you will notice that 
that is what it did when we were simply typing in the lines on the screen!

     Now we must get back to the end of the document, where we had left off 
when we decided to add the word "some" to the first line.  We can do this by
going to the N_ext line, and the N_ext line, until we are where we want to be.  
As you doubtless surmise, we do this with the "Control N" command, N_ for 
N_ext.  Hold down the control key (as you have seen, if you do _n_o_t, the 
characters you type will go into your text!), and press "N" twice.  Each time,
the cursor will move one line down.  We are now on the right line.  You will 
find that you are at the end of that line;  Emacs tries to keep you in the same
"column" when going between lines, but the line with "Multics" on it is much 
shorter than the line you started from (the first line, which now says,
"This is some sample text."), so you are as far as you can be on this line.

     Now let us finish the sentence "Multics is a computer system."  We see
that the cursor is right after the "s" in Multics": if we just type "is", we 
will get

     Multicsis

which is surely not what we want.  So type  a space, and the cursor moves to 
the right as a space goes into your text.  Now continue entering the words

     is a computer system.

and sure enough, your entire text appears correct before you:

     This is some sample text.
     Here is more text yet.
     Multics is a computer system.

     You may want to continue experimenting with the things you have just 
learned:  when you are done, you will have to leave the editor: this is done 
as follows: type a "Control X" followed by a "Control C" (C_ for C_ommand 
level).  This is not an easy command to type or remember, but that is 
reasonable, because you may be editing for hours, and you will only type it 
once.  One way to type it is to hold down the control key, and type an "X" and 
a "C" while holding it.  Emacs will respond,

     Modified buffers exist.  Quit?

because you have done work that you have not written out (we will learn 
about writing out work later).  Answer "yes" (type the letters y, e, and s, 
and a carriage return).  Emacs will clear the screen, and leave you at 
Multics Command level.

     We have now learned the six most important Emacs commands:

     #		Erase the last character
     Control F	Go F_orward one character.
     Control B	Go B_ackward one character.
     Control N	Go to the N_ext line.
     Control P	Go to the P_revious line.
     Control X Control C
		Quit the editor.


     Practice using them until you are thoroughly familiar with them.  They 
are the most important and useful commands.  With these commands, and one or 
two others, you can do just about anything you will ever be called upon to 
do.  All the other commands just make it easier to do more complex things,
but you can always move around and type in text with these commands.


		       Deleting and Killing.

     Next we will learn how to delete text.  We already know something about
this subject; we know how to use "#" to delete characters that we type in
as we type them in.  Here we will learn to remove other portions of the text.
Enter Emacs as before. Type in the following text, as we did before.  So that
you can follow the lesson properly, be careful to break the lines
(type carriage return) exactly as you see here:

     Once upon a time there were four bears.  They lived in a house on the
     edge of the forest.  There was a father bear, a mother bear, and a 
     baby bear. One day the bears went out in the woods.

The last thing you should have typed should have been "woods.", and the
cursor is to the right of the period in "woods.".  Let us now fix the
obvious designated excess of bears: we want to change the word "four" to
"three" in the first line.  As all else in Emacs, the way we do this is to
"go" to the place in question, with the cursor, and then perform local
surgery on the text at the cursor.  Let us use what we have learned before, 
and use the "previous line" command (invoked by striking "Control P")
twice, to get up to the first line.  We now find we are in the middle of
the word "They", and we wish to go backward on this line until we are at the
word "four".  So we use the "backward characters" command, invoked by
striking "Control B", for "backwards".  We probably have to strike it about a 
dozen times, so we should hold down the "control key" (like a shift key) with
one finger and hit "B" about a dozen or so times until the cursor is right
at the letter "f" of the word "four".  If we go too far, go "forward by 
characters" with "Control F" until we are at the "f" of "four".

     This may have seemed long and difficult to get to that word; there are
easier ways, and we will learn them in time, but for now, we will continue to
present the fundamental concepts and commands in the order which will allow
you to do the most as soon as possible.

     We now wish to change the word at the cursor to the word "three".  In 
Emacs, we do not "change" or substitute.  We get rid of what we don't want,
and type in what we do want. So what we will do is _d_e_l_e_t_e the word
"four", and type in the word "three" (which we already know how to do!).
The way we will delete the word "four", for now, is by destroying it one
character at a time. We will use the "delete character" command, which
is invoked by hitting "control D", "D" for D_elete.  Do this once, by
holding down "control" and pressing "D" _o_n_c_e while "control" is down.
Watch the screen. You will see that the first line is now changed:

     Once upon a time there were our bears.  They lived in a house on the

The "f" has disappeared! It has been _r_e_m_o_v_e_d from the line; the cursor
is now under the "o". Note that if we type a (D_O_N_'T_ do it) "t" now,
it will say

     Once upon a time there were tour bears.  They lived in a house on the

So let us get rid of the rest of the word "four" by hitting "Control D"
three more times, slowly, watching the screen.  We now have, when this is 
done:

     Once upon a time there were  bears.  They lived in a house on the

The cursor is under the _s_e_c_o_n_d of the two spaces now between the words
"were" and "bears".  The rest is easy; we type the letters t, h, r, e, and e,
and the word "three" appears letter by letter, between "were" and "bears",
pushing over the rest of the line as we type it. So we have now learned the
"delete character" command, which is used by typing "Control D", which
physically removes the character at the cursor from the screen and our text.

     Often we need to delete a lot more than a few characters; we want to
remove large pieces of lines, or many lines. We will now learn the
"kill lines" command, which is invoked by striking "Control K", K_ for K_ill
Lines.  We wish to change the last sentence,

     One day the bears went out in the woods.

to

     The bears often ate porridge.

Again, the way we do this is to position the cursor to the point we want to
change, and then operate upon the text.  We want to get to the letter "O" in
the word "One" on the last line.  Use the Backward Character, Forward
Character, Next Line, and Previous Line commands (Control B, Control F,
Control N, Control P) any way you know how until the cursor is under the
"O" of the word "One".  Now type a Control K, and watch the screen.  All the 
text between the cursor and the end of the line wil vanish from the screen 
and from the text.  Although we could just type in the new sentence right here
and now, there is a very important feature to be learned at this point.
Type a Control Y. This invokes the "Yank" command: watch the screen.  The text
we had just killed is brought back.  The "Yank" command brings back anything
we just killed, if we decide that killing it was a mistake.  In this way,
we can fix damage that we do by accident by mistaken or inadvertent killing of
text.  Almost every command in Emacs that deletes text puts the text it deletes
into a special safe place called the _k_i_l_l _r_i_n_g, where the Yank command
can find it.  What is more, killed text _s_t_a_y_s in the kill ring
so that you can yank it back many commands later, or even somewhere else in
your text after you accidentally or purposefully killed it; this way, you need
not notice your mistake as soon as you make it.

     The "Delete Character" command does not put the characters it kills
in the kill ring; if you accidentally delete a character, it is easy enough
to retype it; if you delete many characters by hand, it is probably not a 
mistake.

     The Yank command has left the cursor after the sentence it has
retrieved; let us re-position the cursor, with the cursor-moving commands we
know, back to the "O" in "One", and use "Control K" again to remove the
sentence.  Now type in the new sentence,

     The bears often ate porridge.

and the correction is made.

     "Kill Lines" (Control K) is a very versatile command, that does different
things depending upon whether it is used in the end of a line or not.
Let us enter some new text.  Type "Control N" (Next Line) about four times
to get to a fresh place on the screen.  Note that the cursor is at the
left margin; these lines are empty.  Type the following well-known verse:

     I wandered lonely as a cloud
     That floats on high over vales and hills.
     And all at once, I saw a crowd
     A host of lovely daffodils.
     Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
     Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Position the cursor to under the "I" which starts the verse, using
all the cursor positioning commands that you know about.  Now delete
all the text on that line, that is "Kill to the end of the line", by typing
a Control K.  Observe the screen: the line becomes blank. Now type
Control K again, and watch the screen.  All the rest of the poem moves up.
We now state what Control K does, and this explains why:

	When not at the end of a line (i.e., at the beginning, or in the
	   middle, Control K deletes all text between the cursor and the
	   end of the line, leaving the cursor at what is now the end of the
	   line.

	When at the end of a line, Control K "removes the carriage-return",
	   or "sticks the next line on to the end of this one", making one
	   line.  If the line that the cursor is on has nothing in it
	   (except the carriage return), this means make this line go away.

Now type Control K again. The line

     That floats on high over vales and hills

will empty out.  Type it once more, and that (now empty) line will disappear,
and the cursor will be at the beginning of the next line of the poem.  You can
now see that typing Control K many times will delete lines one by one, off the
screen, as you type it.

     Now we will show some magic.  Invoke the "Yank" command again, by
striking a Control Y, and watch the screen.  Both lines we deleted came back,
intact!  There has been something going on behind the scenes on the kill ring
as we have been typing Control K's:  If we type an unbroken succession of
Control K's, the "killed text" is _m_e_r_g_e_d on the kill ring, so that one yank
gets it all back.  Because of this feature, we do not have to painstakingly
reconstruct text that we killed line-by-line as we have done.  If we did not
want to bring all of it back, it is no problem to go back and kill some of the
text that we yanked back and didn't want, but this is a lot easier than having
to retype text that we killed and couldn't yank back.  Almost all Emacs
commands that delete text participate in this _k_i_l_l _m_e_r_g_i_n_g with themselves and
each other to help you recover accidentally deleted text easily, no matter how
you deleted it.


     We have now learned three new commands, for deleting text:

     Control D	Delete Character at cursor.
     Control K	Kill to end of line, if not already at end of line.
		If at end of line, merge line with next line.
     Control Y	Yank back text that we accidentally killed.

     All these commands, of course, delete what is at the cursor, or bring
back text at the position of the cursor.

     Type some text, and experiment with these commands until you feel
comfortable using them, and then exit the editor as we did earlier.

		      Reading and writing files.

     One of the most important things to know how to do is to read in Multics
Files, and write them out.  There are three commands for doing this, and we 
will now learn about them.  When we read in a file, it is read into a 
_b_u_f_f_e_r.  Each file will be read into its own buffer.  When we read a file in, 
the first twenty or so lines will appear on the screen, just as though
you had typed them in.  You only see as many lines at one time as fit on
the screen, however, the whole file is there, and if you try to position
the cursor to some line that is not on the screen, either by doing 
Control N's so that the cursor tries to go off the bottom, or Control P's
so that the cursor tries to go off the top, or any other way,  Emacs will 
choose such lines to display on the screen such that the line you want the
cursor to be on is indeed shown.

      Let us read in a file.  For this we use the "Find File" command.  Enter
Emacs in the usual fashion.  Because we do not read in files that often while
editing, the Find File command requires two keystrokes.  It is invoked by the
two-key sequence "Control X Control F" (the F is for F_ind F_ile).  Type this
by holding down the control key, and typing an X and an F while it is down.

     You will see the cursor go to the bottom of the screen, below the
mode line, and Emacs will say

	Find File:

with the cursor at the end of the word "File: ".  This is called a _p_r_o_m_p_t: 
Emacs is waiting for you to type an "answer" to its question, in this case,
the pathname of the file to be read in.  You are now in the _m_i_n_i_b_u_f_f_e_r, a 
little one-line window below the mode line, used for answering prompts.
We were prompted in the minibuffer previously when we tried to exit Emacs with
modified buffers.  Type the pathname of a file: a good pathname is

     >doc>subsystem>emacs>emacs.info

which is the command writeup for Emacs.  Type this pathname: you need not put
any spaces before or after it.  If you make a mistake while typing, you can use
#, Control B, Control D, Control F, or any other command to edit the
pathname itself while you are typing it!  End the pathname with a 
carriage-return.  Assuming you have typed the pathname correctly,
Emacs will now print the word "Reading.." in the minibuffer, letting you know 
that it is reading in this file, and strike it out when it has finished 
reading it.  A little later, you will see the screen start to fill up with the 
first windowful of the file.  The cursor will be at the first character of the
first line.  Now look at the mode line.  You will see that the buffer
name is no longer "main", but "editor". The buffer name is taken from
the first component of the entry name of the file read in (in this case, 
the file was "editor.info", so it is "editor").  Below the mode line is
something new, the full pathname of the file in this buffer.  This is called
the _p_a_t_h _l_i_n_e, and tells us exactly what file we are editing.  Of course, we 
are not really editing that file, but a copy of it, and the changes we may
make will not be reflected to that file unless we try to write out the
buffer to the file.

     Now type a Control X, and an Equal Sign (=).  Be sure to release the
control key before striking the equals sign.  Be careful to remember to hold
the shift key if equal-sign requires a shift on your terminal.  Emacs will
print in the minibuffer,

     513 lines, current = 1

or something similar. Control X = is the Line Counter command.  It tells you
how many lines there are in your document, and what line number the cursor
is currently on.  Control X = is a handy command to know.

     Now type Next Line commands (Control N) slowly until the cursor is
on the line right above the minibuffer.  Be very careful, just this time,
to do this slowly enough, so that the cursor stays in the main window.
Now note carefully the contents of the line it is on.  I cannot tell you
what line that is, because I don't know how many lines your terminal has
on its screen, and that governs what line your cursor will be on now.
Now strike control N once more.  You will see Emacs rewrite many lines
on your screen, and, if your terminal has the capability to do so, move
many lines around.  When it is finished, the cursor will be at the
beginning of a line in the middle of the screen.  Look at the line
above that.  You will note that it is the same line that was at the bottom
of the screen a second ago.  Control N indeed went to the next line of the
text after the line the cursor was on, as it is supposed to.  Now do another
Control X =.  Emacs will say something like

	513 lines, current = 22

If you look at the screen, you will see that the cursor is on the twelfth
or so line of the screen, not the 22nd!  However, you are editing the
file (or the buffer) and not the screen!  The line you are on is indeed the
twenty-second line of the file.  If you were near the end, you might be on
the 500th line or so, even though there are only 21 lines or so in the main 
window.  Since you can only display about 21 lines at once, Emacs chooses
_w_h_i_c_h 21 lines automatically to make sure the line that you want the
cursor to be on is on the screen.

     You can now edit this file as though you had typed it in, using all the 
commands that you know.  You can move the cursor about, delete characters,
kill lines, or enter new text at will.  Try putting in a new word or
killing a line.  At once, the word

     Modified

will appear in the minibuffer, letting you know that you have changed the
file since you read or wrote it, and will have to write it
out if you want your work to be saved.  It is not easy to do five hundred
Control N's to get through the file; we will learn more ways later of 
moving around buffers faster.

     Having made some editing changes to the file, we want to write it out.
The command that writes back a file that you read it is called "Save same 
file": it is invoked by the two-character sequence Control X Control S
(S for S_ave).  Try it.  You will get the error message

	Incorrect access on entry.

You cannot write out this file, because it is my file, and I did not give you
the access required to write on my file.  So let us write it out to a copy in
our own directory:  For this, we use the Write File command, which is invoked
by the two-character sequence Control X Control W (W for W_rite File).  Enter
this sequence.  Emacs will prompt in the minibuffer:

     Write File:

Now type the pathname of a place you want to write it to:

     myinfo.info

End with a carriage return.  You will see the path line change to indicate
the new pathname.  As Emacs is writing it, you will see the word "Writing.."
appear in the minibuffer.  When the word "Written." replaces the word 
"Writing..", you know that the file has been successfully written out to
the Multics Storage System.

     Now you can edit some more, and move around within the buffer, and
when you wish to write the file out again, to the same place it was last
written to, Save Same File (Control X Control S) will do the trick. Again,
the Writing../Written in the minibuffer lets you know when Emacs is done
writing.

     We have now learned four new commands:

     Control X Control F	Find file, read in a file. Asks for pathname
			   in the minibuffer.

     Control X Control S	Save Same File, writing out the buffer to the
			   last place it was read from or written to.

     Control X Control W	Write File: Write a file to a new place.
			   Asks for pathname in the minibuffer.

     Control X =		Line Counter: tell how many lines in the buffer,
			   and what line we are on.


			    Searching


     A fundamental ability that is needed in editing is that of looking
for a particular sequence of characters, or _s_e_a_r_c_h_i_n_g.  In the context of 
E__m_a_c_s, this means finding a given sequence of characters in the buffer,
and moving the cursor to that point.  There are two simple commands
for searching in Emacs: we will learn them next.

     Enter Emacs as usual.  Enter the following text:

     Now is the time and the only time for those who have
     their time to give their time.

     Using Control P (Previous Line) and Control B (Backward Character)
move the cursor to the upper left hand corner (under the "N" of "Now")
of the screen.  We will now search for the word "time".  We use the
String Search command, which is gotten by typing a Control S. Do it.
Emacs responds in the minibuffer:

     String Search:

We now enter the four letters t, i, m, and e.  End the string with a carriage
return.   You will see the cursor return
to the main window, but now it will be immediately after the first occurence
of the word "time".  Let us replace the word "time" here by "day".  We will
learn a little trick.  By all rights, we should go backwards (Control B)
four times, and then delete characters (Control D) four times to delete
the word "time".  That would work; however, there is an easier way.  Type
a pound sign (#).  Note that the "e" of "time" goes away.  If we type
the "#" another three times, the t, i, and m will go away too!  This is what
pound sign always does: it deletes the character to the left of the cursor,
whether you just typed it in or not.  Think about it.  When you type in a
character, the cursor moves to the right of it, and it is now to the left of 
the cursor.  Typing pound sign makes it go away because pound sign deletes
the character to the left of the cursor.  This is distinct from Control D,
which deletes the character _a_t the cursor.

     Finish deleting the first occurence of the word "time", and type in
"day".  Now let us look for "grime".  Type a Control S, and in response to the
prompt "String Search:  ", type the letters g, r, i, m, and e, and a
carriage return.  Emacs will respond

     Search fails.

in the minibuffer, because it could not find the string "grime", and
the cursor remains in the place where it was when the Control S was
typed.  Now let us again look for "time".  Type a Control S, the letters
t, i, m, and e, and carriage-return.  The cursor advances to the next "time"
in the buffer.  Do it again, and the same thing happens.  Note carefully
that Control S only searches forward in the buffer, from where the cursor
is at the time it is used to the end of the buffer. It will not look
backwards.  That is why it puts you _a_f_t_e_r the string it finds, so that
it will not find the same one all the time.  Note how easily we can find
the same string many times in a line.

     Now go back to the beginning of the buffer, with Control P's and
Control B's.  We are going to look for the string "time" again, but this
time, a little bit differently.  Type a Control S.  Emacs again prompts,

     String Search:

Type a carriage return..  You will see Emacs put the word "time" right in the
minibuffer, as though you had typed it, and find the first "time".  When you
answer a search command's prompt with an "empty search string", that is to
say, typing carriage return, Emacs will re-use the last "search string"
(sequence of characters) you were searching for.  This applies to all the
various search commands.  Using this, we can search many times for the same
thing, without having to retype it into the minibuffer.  Search two or three
times for "time" again (please do this, so that this lesson will continue to
work).

     Now we will learn a very important Emacs command, "Get out of what you
are doing", which is gotten by issuing a Control G.  Try it.  Your terminal
will beep at you.  Control G always causes your terminal to beep at you.
Now type a Control S again.  Emacs will prompt in the minibuffer, as always,

     String Search:

Suppose we decide that we didn't want to search for anything, and that typing
the Control S was a mistake.  Now type a Control G: the cursor will exit
the minibuffer, and the terminal will beep.  The search command has been
aborted.  Control G  can always be used to exit the minibuffer to abort
any command that you change your mind about in midstream, such as
Find File, or Write File, etc.  It can also be used after typing a
large number of cursor movement commands to cause your terminal to "beep"
when they are all done.  Sometimes, this is useful when the system is slow,
as a way of letting you know that Emacs has "caught up" to what you told it
to do.  Control G is very important, it is an "out" whenever you start
doing something that you change your mind about, or aren't sure what you 
typed.  If you ever find yourself in the minibuffer with a prompt that
you think you didn't  ask for, or don't understand, like

     Eval:

you can be sure that typing a Control G will get you out of it without
doing any harm.

     The next command we will learn about is Reverse String Search:  it is
invoked by striking a Control R.  Try it.  Strike a Control R.  Emacs will
prompt in the minibuffer:

     Reverse String Search:

Type carriage return, like for Control S (String Search).  The string "time"
will appear in the minibuffer, as we had promised.  The cursor will be left
_b_e_f_o_r_e (i.e., under the first character of) the first occurence
of "time" going backwards from where the cursor was when you typed the
Control R.  If the cursor was right after a "time", it will now be at the
front of the same one.  Do it again.  The cursor will go one "time" back
each time, until there are no more between the cursor and the beginning of the
buffer, at which time Emacs will respond

     Search Fails.

in the minibuffer.  If we want to change one of these "time"s to an
"hour", we need only type four Control D's (Delete Character) and the
word "hour" after finding one.

     Reverse String Search is just like String Search, except

	1. It goes backward to the beginning of the buffer, while forward
	   search goes forwrd to the end.
	2. It leaves the cursor _b_e_f_o_r_e (at the front of) the found
	   string, while String Search leaves it _a_f_t_e_r.

Otherwise, String Search and Reverse String Search both prompt in the
minibuffer, take a string terminated by a carriage return to use for a search
target, and use an empty string (a carriage return as answer) to indicate that
the last search string used should be used again.

     When you are searching for something in Emacs, you have to know if you
want to search forward or backward for it, from where you are now; usually,
you know this.  If you don't, you should search forward.  If the search fails,
just hit a Control R and a carriage return, and Emacs will search backward for
the same string.  If _t_h_a_t search fails, the string is really not in the
buffer.

     We now have learned three new commands:

     Control S	String Search. Prompts for a string in the minibuffer,
		   which must end with a carriage return.  An empty string
		   uses the last string over again.  Searches forward for
		   that string to the end of the buffer, and leaves you
		   after it.

     Control R	Reverse String Search.  Same as above, but goes backward.
		   Leaves you at start of found string.

     Control G	(Command Quit) Get out of anything, and beep the
		   terminal.  Often used to get out of minibuffer
		   prompts that you change your mind about.


		       Two Very Useful Commands

     We will now learn two useful commands that you will use all the time.
We will not give any examples here, because what they do is so simple.  Try
them yourself any way you want, but learn them.

     Control A	Go to beginning of line.  Moves the cursor to the beginning
		   of whatever line it is on.  The way to rememeber it
		   is that "A is the first letter at the beginning of the
		   alphabet".  We could not use "B" for "Beginning",
		   because, as we know, Control B is for "Backward
		   Character".

     Control E	Go to end of line (E for E_nd).  Moves the cursor
		   to the end (after the last character, before the
		   carriage return) of whatever line it is now on.
		   On a line with nothing on it (nothing _i_n it but a
		   carriage return), this does nothing.



		   Wiping, the Mark, and the Region

     We will now learn three new concepts, and three new commands.
We will learn them in order to be able to delete arbitrary extents of text
(i.e., "from here to there", or "all that stuff") as opposed to killing
lines and characters carefully to get rid of exactly what we want.  Enter
Emacs.  Type in a paragraph or so of text, of your choice.  Choose a
few words next to each other somewhere.  It is all right if they are not
on the same lines.  Let us delete this "extent", that "much" of the text.
The command we will be using is Wipe Region, which is invoked from
Control W (for W_ipe Region).  We tell it what to "wipe", that is, wipe off
the screen and out of the text, or delete, by giving it the "here" and 
"there", that is, the "limits" or "boundaries" of the region to delete.
It will delete all the text between the two points we tell it to.

     How do we specify the "region" of our buffer that control W is to delete?
By its limits.  How do we specify the limits?  One limit will be the cursor
at the time we strike the Control W.  The other is specified by an "invisible
cursor" called "the mark".  There is at most one "mark" in each buffer.  Until
we "set the mark", there is no mark in the buffer.  Type a Control W.
You will find that Emacs will complain that there is no mark, and nothing
will happen.  We "set the mark" by moving the cursor to the place we
want "the mark" to be, and issuing the command "Set the Mark", which is
invoked by Control @. This is a very tricky command to type.  It is typed,
like any control character, by holding the control key, and typing, in
this case, the character @.  On some terminals, you may even have to
hold Control and Shift at once to make this happen, if you normally have
to hold the Shift key to get an @.  If you have trouble with this, ask someone
familiar with the terminals in use at your site; tell him you are trying to
"Generate an ASCII NULL, or a Control At Sign", and hopefully he or she can
show you how to type one.

     Move the cursor to be under the _f_i_r_s_t character of the first word that
you have singled out for deletion.  We will set "the mark" here.  Type the
Control @.  Absolutely nothing will happen: this command doesn't "do"
anything visible.  Now move the cursor to right _a_f_t_e_r the _l_a_s_t letter of the
_l_a_s_t word in the group we singled out for deletion.  We are now ready, in
principle, to issue the Control W (Wipe Region) command, but let's not.
There is usually something we want to do right before issuing a Control W: We
want to check that "the mark" is where we think it is, because it might have
been some time ago that we set it.  For this we use the command "Exchange
Point and Mark" ("point" is the name for the place in the buffer that the
cursor is located at.  If you don't understand the difference between that
and the cursor itself, ignore it for now.) This command switches the cursor
and "the mark" around, putting the cursor where the mark was and the mark
where the cursor was.  The visible effect of this is to move the cursor to
where the mark was, so we can see where it was.  The "Exchange Point and Mark"
command is issued by typing Control X Control X (i.e., two Control X's in a 
row).  Remember "X" for E_xchange.  Do it.  The cursor will move to under the
first character of the region we are trying to delete, the place where we
had set the mark.  Now before doing any other commands, do another
Exchange Point and Mark (Control X Control X) to get back.
It is very important that you do not move the cursor at all before typing
the second pair of Control X's, or you will exchange the mark with the
wrong point!  It is very common to type Control X Control X, Control X
Control X in this way, to "verify" the "region" between the "point" and
"the mark".

     Now issue the Control W (Wipe Region) command.  You will see that all
the text you singled out for deletion disappears from the screen (and thus
from your text).  If there was a carriage return in the middle of them, you 
will see that that too has gone, and one big line now replaces the two lines
between which the carriage return had been.

     Like The Kill Lines command (Control K), the Wipe Region command
(Control W) puts what it removes in the kill ring.  Type a Control Y now
(the Y_ank command).  All the text you had deleted reappears.  If you
ever hit Control W by accident (for instance, instead of Control E), and
see loads of text mysteriously vanish, just type Control Y and it will
all come back.  As a matter of fact, if you ever see text vanish off your
screen or out of your buffer for a reason that you don't think you understand,
the chances are better than even that simply typing a Control Y will
fix it all up.

     A useful feature of the Yank command is that it puts "the mark" at the
_b_e_g_i_n_n_i_n_g of the text it retrieves, and (as can be seen), leaves
the cursor after it.  This has two implications that should be noted:

     1. After you have yanked some text, no matter for what reason, you
        can make it go away again simply by typing Control W (Wipe Region),
        since the cursor and the mark exactly specify the boundaries of
        what was yanked.

    2.  After you have yanked something, no matter for what reason, you
        can get to (move the cursor) to the beginning of the yanked text
        by exchanging the cursor and the mark, simply by typing
        two Control X's, the "Exchange Pont and Mark" command.

     If we had known the second of these facts when we were learning about
Control K (Kill Lines), we could have gotten to the beginning of the
sentence

     One day they went out in the woods.

after we had yanked it back simply by typing Control X Control X.

     The text in the buffer between the cursor and the mark is called 
"the region".  There are many Emacs commands besides Wipe Region (Control W)
which use the region, and the commands we learned for setting the limits
of the region and testing what they are are useful for all of them.

     We have learned three new commands:

     Control @	Set the mark to be where the cursor is now.

     Control X Control X
		Switch the cursor and the mark around, to show us
		where the mark was.  The mark is now where the cursor
		was, and the cursor is now where the mark was.

     Control W	Wipe Region.  Remove the text between the mark and the
		cursor from the text and the screen.  Save it on the
		kill ring for possible subsequent yanking.

			Numeric Arguments


     Next we learn about how to say "go FIVE characters forward", or 
"go FOUR next lines down" and so forth.  Commands for which it is meaningful
and useful to specify "how many times" to do them usually will accept what
is called a "numeric argument", which is essentially a repetition count.
For instance, if we give the "Next Line" command (Control N) a numeric
argument of 25, it will go 25 lines down instead of one line down as it usually
does.  If we give the "Delete Character" command (Control D) a numeric
argument of 6, it will delete 6 characters, instead of the one it usually
does.

     Search around on your keyboard for a key labelled "ESC", "ESCAPE",
"ALT", or "ALTMODE", or something like that.  This is called the "ESCAPE"
key, which generates a character called the "ESCAPE character".   We
will refer to it by the letters ESC; this means strike and release the
ESCAPE key, do _n_o_t type the letters E, S, and C!

     We specify a numeric argument to a command by typing an ESC character
(hitting and releasing the ESCAPE key once), the number we want, and
the command we want to receive the argument.  For instance, to delete
six characters, we would type the _t_h_r_e_e keys

	   ESC  6   Control-D

That is, strike the escape key, the 6 key, and a Control D in that order.
All the characters will disappear at once: you will not see them go one by
one.  Similarly, if you said

	ESC 249 Control-N

while on the first line of a large file, the screen would fill immediately
with lines 240 to 261 (roughly) of the file, with line 250 and the cursor
in the middle.  You will be spared watching the cursor and the screen
step through 250 lines one by one; it is done all at once.

     The following commands that we have already learned about accept
a numeric argument to mean "Do it that many times".  The complete list
is given in the Emacs reference document:

	Control B		Backward Character
	Control D		Delete Character
	Control F		Forward Character
	Control N		Next Line
	Control P		Previous Line

If you give a numeric argument to Control K (Kill lines), it does _n_o_t
do that many Control K's, it does something more useful.  Starting
with the current point on the current line, it kills entirely (removes)
that many _e_n_t_i_r_e lines.  Thus, if you are at the beginning of a line
(doing a Control A, Go to Beginning of Line can ensure this), 

	ESC 4 Control-K

will delete this and the next three lines entirely.  Of course, these
lines will be put as one on the kill ring, and will "_k_i_l_l _m_e_r_g_e"
with preceding or following "kill type" commands as described above.

     The "Yank" command also does something useful and different with
a numeric argument.  The kill ring is so called because it is like a ring
of text excerpts that were deleted.  Whenever you kill some text,
the "ring" is rotated one of its ten positions, and the newly killed text
goes in the front position, replacing what had been in the tenth position.
It is like a merry-go-round with ten horses, and one on/off point.
The ten positions on the kill ring thus contain the last ten text excerpts
that you killed.  (When kill merging occurs, this does not happen, as the
new text gets "stuck on to" the text in the ring at the on/off point).
When you use a "Yank" command (Control Y), it is always the latest thing
that you killed (i.e., the excerpt at the on/off point) that is retrieved.
If you want the _s_e_c_o_n_d latest thing instead, simply give the
Yank command a numeric argument of 2 by typing

	ESC 2 Control-Y

instead of just

	Control-Y

and that will happen.

	There is a wonderful command that expresses the following situation.
"I deleted some text.  Then I went somewhere else, and I deleted some
more text.  Then I decided that the first text I deleted was really O.K.;
deleting it was a mistake.  So I went back to the point where I deleted it
from, and used the Yank command (Control Y).  However, that was a mistake,
because it brought back the text from the second thing I had deleted,
which was, indeed, the last thing I had deleted.  I wish I could say
"Get rid of that stuff, and bring back the previous saved text in the
kill ring." "

     There is such a command.  It does precisely that.  It gets rid of
the text between the cursor and the mark (which was, presumably just yanked
by mistake), without saving it on the kill ring, "rotates" the kill ring
one position _b_a_c_k_w_a_r_d_s, and retrieves the text at the on/off station.

It is typed by the two-character sequence

	ESC y

That is to say, press the two keys, ESCAPE and Y (lower case or capital, it
does not matter) one after the other.  (Be careful to type the two-key
sequence deliberately and firmly; do NOT hold down the ESC key while typing
Y: it is NOT like the CONTROL key.)   It is called the "Wipe this and Yank
Previous" command:

     ESC Y	Wipe this and Yank Previous.  I don't like what
		   I just yanked.  Get rid of it, and bring out the
		   previous thing I killed.

By doing many ESC Y's in a row, until you "find the kill that you want",
you can "go shopping" in the kill ring for saved text.

     Whether you realize it or not, normal letters and numbers are actually
Emacs commands, too!  For instance, we know that Control D means "Delete the
character at the cursor".  But what does an ordinary "D" mean?  What happens
when you type an ordinary "D"?  What happens when you type any number or letter
or punctuation mark?  It goes into the buffer, and appears on the screen.
The first thing we ever did was to type ordinary text into Emacs.
Printing characters (other than #, @, and \), are said to be
_s_e_l_f-_i_n_s_e_r_t_i_n_g, because if you type one, it inserts itself into
the text.

     We mention this now because giving a numeric argument to a self-inserting
character causes it to insert itself that many times.  For instance,
if we type

	ESC 2 4 Q

we will see twenty four Q's appear on the screen all at once.  This is a
good way to get lines of dashes, underscores, stars, etc.

     If ever you type a numeric argument, or are in the middle of typing
a numeric argument, or have just typed  ESC, and you decide that you
didn't mean it, or you are not sure as to whether you typed the numeric
argument or not, type a Control G, which G_ets you out of anything.  The
reassuring beep of Control G will verify that any possible numeric argument
has been discarded.

	        The First Help Command, and Local Displays

     There is a command that will tell you what command a given key performs.
This is a good command to use if you are not sure what a given key does, and
you do not have the documentation on hand.  It displays the documentation for
a given command on the screen.  It is called Describe Key, and is invoked by
striking the two-key sequence

     ESC ?

Try it.  Let's find out about what Control E is and does.
Type an ESC, and then a question mark.  Emacs will prompt in the
minibuffer with

     Explain Key:

Now actually type a Control E, in the usual manner.  Emacs will probably wait
a little while before responding, especially if this is the first time you
have used ESC ? since entering Emacs and system load is heavy.  Be patient.
The documentation for Control E, Go to End of Line, will appear at the top of
the screen, replacing whatever text you were editing on the screen.  Bu do not
worry, it did not destroy your text; it is just being "displayed" to you on
the screen "in front of" your text.  The line of dashes and stars:

     -- * * * * * * * * * * * * --

is there to let you know that your buffer has not been destroyed, but simply
that there is information being displayed for you to see "in front of" it.
Such a display is called a L__o_c_a_l D__i_s_p_l_a_y.  We will shortly learn how to get
rid of the local display, when we are finished viewing it, and restore the
window on our buffer to the screen.

     The documentation for Control E begins with the line

     ^E	     go-to-end-of-line

"^E" is the shorthand for "Control E" which is used in the reference document,
and in displays and error messages produced by Emacs.  It is a good shorthand,
because "Control X Control Q ESC B Control D" etc., can get long-winded.
We will use this convention from hereon in.  When we say "^A", we will mean
"Control A", i.e., hold down the control key and strike an A", _n_o_t the
character "^" followed by an "A".

     "go-to-end-of-line" is the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d _n_a_m_e associated with
^E. At this stage, it serves only to remind us of what ^E does.  When a great
deal of proficiency in using Emacs has been acquired, these command names
can be used in computer programs to build commands of your own.
As a matter of fact, once you know the command name, you can "connect" any key
of your choice to any command of your choice if you don't like the default
layout of what key does what (see the writeup of the "set-key" and
"set-permanent-key" extended commands if you want to learn about this).

     The documentation describing go-to-end-of-line follows the line giving
the key name and command name.  The documentation is the same that you would
find in the Emacs reference document; it describes everything there is to know
about the command in question.

     When we have finished viewing the local display of the command
documentation, we wish to remove it from the screen.  If you just start
editing again, typing editor commands, the display will vanish as soon as you
start typing, putting back on the screen what had been there.  However, you
might not know where the cursor was "supposed to be", because the local
display is standing there in front of it.  For this reason, a command is
provided that does _n_o_t_h_i_n_g _a_t _a_l_l.  Since typing _a_n_y editor command makes the
local display go away, this command may be used for making local displays go
away without doing anything else.  It is invoked by striking the Linefeed key
on your terminal.  The "noop" (No Operation) command is invoked by Linefeed
(which is the same as Control J on all terminals).  For reasons too complex to
describe here, it is recommended, and cannot hurt, to hit Linefeed two or
three times to get rid of a local display.

     Sometimes, local displays will take more than one screen.  In this case,
the last line of the screen will say

     --More?-- (Space = yes, CR = no)

If you see this on the last line of the window, hit the space bar once to see
each successive screen of the local display.  When you are at the last screen
of the local display, the line of dashes and stars

     -- * * * * * * * * * * * --

will appear, and Linefeeds may be used to restore the buffer to the screen.
If, during a multi-screen local display, you decide that you do not want to
see the rest of the display, typing a carriage return instead of the space bar
will terminate the display and restore the buffer to the screen.

     Occasionally, you may forget what command a given key invokes, or need to
find out "what you just did by accident".  You can ask for the name of the
command invoked by a given key without the documentation.  This can be
preferable at low terminal speeds, or on a slow system, where the local
display can take some time, or if you just need a reminder of what is
"connected" to some given key. This can be done with the Describe Key command
by giving it a numeric argument, i.e.,

     ESC 1 ESC ?

(a four-key sequence).  Type that.  Emacs will prompt:

     Show Key Function:

Type, for instance, a Control W.  Emacs will respond in the minibuffer,

     ^W = wipe-region

which is precisely what we wanted to know.

   We now know two new commands:

     ESC ?	Describe Key.  Prompts for you to type a key,
		   and supplies the documentation for that key as
		   a local display.  If given a numeric argument,
		   tells what command is invoked by that key.

     Linefeed	No Operation.  Type it two or three times to remove
		   a local display from the screen.


		      T__h_e B__u_f_f_e_r _a_n_d _t_h_e S__c_r_e_e_n


     Very often we wish to "page" through a document, reading through it like
a book, either to actually read it, or to "flip through" until we arrive at
the place we want to see or edit.  Using Emacs, this is accomplished by
"paging" through the text in the buffer screen by screen.  That is to say,
after we finish reading or looking at the text on the screen, we want to see
the next screenful (actually, the next windowful).  The next windowful of text
is that text in the buffer which immediately follows the text now in the
window.  That is the text we wish to progress to, and fill the window with.
The command for doing this is "Next Screen", which is gotten by striking
Control V (for V_iew Next Screen).  This is a very easy key to type with your
left hand alone; use your thumb, while holding down the control key, to page
through successive windowfuls of a document.

     Read in some file and "^V through it".  You will note that each time you
strike a Control V, the cursor will be left at the upper left-hand corner of
the screen: not only has the window been filled with new text, but the cursor
is now in a different place in the buffer, at the beginning of the text which
fills the window.  The text now in the window, of course, is not the only part
of the buffer you may edit.  If, for instance, after using ^V, you use a ^P to
go to the previous line, you will observe Emacs choosing a different portion
of the buffer to display in the window.  Emacs usually chooses its window,
(i.e., what part of the buffer to show in the window) automatically, governed
by where in the _b_u_f_f_e_r you moved the cursor. ^V is one of several ways, and
the first we have learned thus far, to explictly select what will be displayed
in the window.

     Note that when you use ^V, the first line of the new screen will be the
same as the last line of the old screen.  This is to give you some context,
and a sense of continuity, so you will know you haven't missed anything, or
forgotten what you were reading while the screen was being refilled.

     As we can page "forward" through a buffer, so we can page "backward" as
well.  As this is less common, it takes two keystrokes.  The two-key sequence
ESC V invokes the "Previous Screen" command.  Remember, C__o_n_t_r_o_l V for the next
screen, E__s_c_a_p_e V for the previous one.  ESC V will make the last line of the
new screen be the same as the first line of the old one.

     Now we can go forward and backward through the buffer line by line (^N
and ^P), character by character (^F and ^B), windowful by windowful (^V and
ESC V), or by searching (^S and ^R), and we will learn many more ways yet.
However, among the most common of needs are to go to the _b_e_g_i_n_n_i_n_g of the
buffer, the _e_n_d of the buffer, and to a given line number.
The command "Go to Beginning of Buffer" is invoked by the two-key sequence
ESC <. Think of the "less than sign" as an arrow pointing backward to the
beginning of the buffer.  Using ESC < will place the first windowful of the
buffer on the screen, and place the cursor at the very first character of the
buffer.  This is often useful when  going through the entire buffer looking
for something or changing things one by one as you see them.

     As you might have guessed, ESC > is "Go to End of Buffer".  The "greater
than sign" may be thought of as a little arrow pointing to the end of the
buffer.   It places the last  windowful of the buffer on the screen, and
places the cursor on the newline character (the "carriage return") which ends
the last line of the text in the buffer.  That is the furthest place in the
buffer that the cursor can go; it is the end of the last line in the buffer.
There is no way to move the cursor to beyond that character.  If, after using
ESC >, you see the cursor on a line by itself, that simply means that there is
an "empty line", i.e., one with nothing but a newline in it, at the end of the
buffer.

     When editing Multics programs, it is often very useful to go to a given
line number (e.g., the 240'th line of the buffer), because many Multics tools
give diagnostics in terms of line numbers in their input files.  If you happen
to be positioned on the first line of the buffer, going to the 241's line is
easy; just do 240 ^N's by typing

     ESC 2 4 0 ^N

If you are not on the first line, you could use ^X= (Line Counter) to figure
out where you are, subtract, and use ^P or ^N with the right numeric
argument, but this is hardly reasonable.  Therefore, Emacs provides the
"Go to Line Number" command, which is invoked by the two-key sequence
ESC G (G for G_o).  The numeric argument to ESC G tells it what line number to
go to.  For instance,

     ESC 2 5 9 ESC G

will move the cursor to (the beginning of) line 259 of your text, no matter
what line you are on now.  As is the case with searching, ^N and ^P, and any
Emacs cursor movement commands, if the target of the motion (the place in the
_t_e_x_t being gone to) is not on the screen, a new window will be selected and
displayed automatically such that the target of the motion _i_s on the screen.

     When editing multiple files, each use of ^X^F (Find File) will result in
a new buffer.  You may switch between buffers with the "Go Buffer" command,
which is invoked by ^XB (B for B_uffer).  Be careful when typing this command:
be sure to release the control key before typing the "B" (the B need not be
capitalized;  Emacs does not distinguish between upper and lower case letters
in editor commands (other than self-inserting characters)).  When you type a
Control X and a B, Emacs will prompt for a buffer name to go to.  Type the
name of the target buffer, ended by a carriage return.  If you give the name
of a buffer that does not exist, Emacs will create such a buffer, and display
it on the screen (you will see an empty window).  If you give the name of a
buffer that does exist, Emacs will refresh the screen with the last windowful
of that buffer that you were editing, that is to say, such a window of that
buffer that the last point you were at with the cursor when editing in it is
now on the screen, and the cursor will be placed at that point.

     Note that when you switch buffers with "Go Buffer", the mode line
changes, to indicate the new buffer name (and the new buffer modes, if they
have changed as well, because modes may be different in different buffers, and
are "remembered" in that buffer.  We will learn later about some useful
modes.)  The path line (the line under the mode line) will change as well, to
let you know the pathname of the file which was read into this buffer (or last
written out from it).

     You may list all of the buffers in a given invocation of Emacs with the
"List Buffers" command, ^X^B (Control X, Control B).  The listing of buffers
will be displayed as a local display; hit linefeed two or three times to get
rid of it, as all local displays.  The name of each buffer, and the pathname
of the file in it, if any, will be displayed.  To the left of the buffer names
will be two symbols, for some buffers, ">" and "*". The "greater than" sign
will be placed to the left of the name of the buffer in which you are now
editing.  The star will be next to the name of any buffer which is "modified",
i.e., has never been written out (but isn't empty), or has been modified since
last read in or written out.  Only when there are "no stars" will ^X^C allow
you to exit Emacs without querying you.

     Go Buffer (^XB) provides a convenient service for going back to the last
buffer you came from.  If you answer its prompt

     Buffer:

with _j_u_s_t a carriage return, i.e., no buffer name, Go Buffer will go back to
the last buffer you had been in before entering the current buffer.  This may
be used to "visit" another buffer and come back easily.

     Occasionally, you may not believe what you see on the screen.  Sometimes
bad telephone lines, or unexpected messages from Multics, or things you just
don't understand ("I _k_n_o_w that's not there!) may cause the screen contents to
become invalid.  This may be due to hardware problems, bugs in new versions of
Emacs, or bugs in your terminal.  At any rate, there is a need to clear the
entire screen and put it back the way it should be, without any regard for
what was there.  This is like clearing one's throat, or clearing the top
of the table.  This is accomplished with the Redisplay Command, which is
gotten by striking ^L.  ^L is used for this purpose because many terminals,
and some parts of the Multics Communications System, associate the Control L
character with the clearing of screens. Try striking ^L; you will see the
screen clear, and be refilled, with the cursor in the middle of the screen
(unless you are at the top of your text buffer, in which case it will be at
the top).  On fast terminals, ^L can be used just to "reposition the window"
such that the line with the cursor on it is at the middle of the window.
(this will work on all terminals, but may be too slow to be useful on slow
lines).  ^L will also make local displays go away, and on fast terminals, is
often used for this purpose as well.  ^L with a numeric argument is used to
reposition the window, i.e., keep the cursor at the same point in the buffer,
but  "move the window around" so that the line with the cursor on it
is at a place of your choosing in the window; a numeric arguemtn of zero is
the top of the window, and so forth. See fundamental-mode.info for more
information on this.

     We have now learned seven new commands for manipulating screens and
buffers:

     Control V	Next Screen. View the next screen of the buffer
		   in the window, and leave the cursor at its top.

     ESC V	Previous screen.  View the previous screen of the
		   buffer in the window, leave the cursor at its top.

     ESC <	Go to the beginning of the buffer.

     ESC >	Go to the end of the buffer.

     Control X B	Go Buffer.  Prompt for the name of another buffer,
		   and switch to it, displaying it on the screen at the
		   last point you left off editing it. If you give
		   ^XB no buffer name, it will go to the previous buffer
		   you had been in.

     Control X Control B
		List Buffers.  Show as local display the names,
		file pathnames, and modified/not modified status of
		all existent buffers.

     Control L	Redisplay Command.  Clear the screen and refresh it,
		eliminating possible non-understood garbage.  With a 
		numeric argument, reposition the window.

     ESC G	Go to Line Number.  Go to the beginning of the line
		whose line number is supplied as a numeric argument.


		    A__p_r_o_p_o_s _a_n_d E__x_t_e_n_d_e_d C__o_m_m_a_n_d_s

     Some commands are issued by a single keystroke, such as ^D, which invokes
the Delete Character comand, delete-char.  Other, less common ones, are
invoked by two-key sequences beginning with ESC, such as ESC G, which invokes
the command go-to-line-number.  Others, less common yet, are invoked by
two-character sequences beginning with ^X (X for E_xtended key).  Commands that
are the least common have to be invoked by actually typing in the name of the
command.

     By "less common", we do not mean that a command is obscure, little-used,
less important, or not widely known or understood.  What we do mean is that
during the course of normal editing, you will use it fewer times than more
common commands.  For instance, you only use ^X^C (quit-the-editor) once per
editing session, but it is one of the first and most important commands you
must learn!  The commands that you must type most often are made the easiest
to type.  The simplest commands to type (the single key "control"'s) are those
that you would want to type _r_a_p_i_d_l_y.  A fine example of this is ^T,
twiddle-chars, which exchanges the last two characters typed.  It is not a
necessary command, as two pound signs and two more characters can do whatever
it does.  But given that ^T can be typed in one character, it is useful.

     The commands known as "Extended Commands" are those invoked by typing
their command names at Emacs.  An example of an extended command is "fillon",
which enters "fill mode" in a buffer.  Fill mode is a setup of a buffer such
that you do not have to worry about the ends of lines when typing text, and
never type carraige return (except, of course, when ending prompts, or where
you want explicit control over the format and line-breaks of your document).
Fill mode is ideal for typing in text from a written page, or composing a
document spontaneously.  One types and types and lines get broken
automatically.

    To invoke the "fillon" command, we clearly cannot just type the characters
"fillon" at Emacs, or they will go into the buffer like any other characters.
We must somehow tell Emacs that we wish to type the name of an extended
command.  The "Extended Command" command, which is invoked by ESC X, does this.
The "X" is for E_xtended.  Type the two-key sequence Escape X.
Emacs will prompt in the minibuffer,

     Command:

Now type the word "fillon" (no quotes, just the six characters), followed by a
carriage return.  You will see the name of the "fill" _m_i_n_o_r _m_o_d_e appear in the
mode line after the name of the current _m_a_j_o_r _m_o_d_e (Fundamental).

     In general, we invoke an extended command by typing ESC X, the name of
the command (and then any arguments, if the extended command takes command
arguments), and a carriage return.

     Now try fill mode.  Type in a long, very long sentence, consisting of
very many real, separate words.  Watch what happens when you get to the end of
the screen, as you type successive words.   Do not worry about typing carriage
return; your lines will be automatically "filled" as they become too long.

     The most important extended command is the "apropos" extended command.
"Apropos is a word (from the French) meaning "about, or having to do with".
It is used to find the names, and keys, of all commands that have to do with a
given topic.  It is used if you remember something about a particular command,
but you cannot remember the key that invokes this particular command, or what
its name is.  The "apropos" extended command will find all commands that have
a given character string in their name, and tell you what keys invoke them.

     For instance, suppose you forgot the name of the key that went to the end
of a line.  Type

     ESC X apropos end CR

(The "CR" means "carriage return").  Apropos will display, as a local display,
the names of all commands available in this buffer whose names contain the
character string "end".  It will tell you of ^E (go-to-end-of-line),
ESC > (go-to-end-of-buffer), and a few surprises (such as ^XM, s_e_n_d-mail), and
others.  Once we learn from apropos what commands are available, we may be
jolted into recognition ("Oh, yes, ^E was go-to-end-of-line!"), or need more
information ("Hmm, ^E looks right. I'd like to know more about it."), and use
ESC ? (Describe Key), by typing, say ESC ? ^E, to get the full documentation
on a particular command.

     Apropos will also list all relevant extended commands, when listing
commands whose names speak of a particular topic.  We cannot use ESC ?
(Describe Key) to find out about extended commands, for it prompts for a
single key, and tells about it.  If we typed "fillon" to ESC ?, it would read
the "f", and tell us about "f" ("f" puts an f into the buffer, etc.), and put
"illon" into our buffer.  So, there exists an extended command to retrieve
documentation for extended commands: it is called "describe".  To find out
about the "fillon" extended command, we type

     ESC X describe fillon CR

The command documentation will be shown as a local display.  We can find out
about describe itself,

     ESC x describe describe CR

or about apropos

     ESC X describe apropos CR

if that is what we want to do.


    We now know the three commands that constitute the core of the Emacs
self-documentation and help system:

     ESC ?	Describe Key.  Prompts for a one or two key sequence,
		    and gives as local display the documentation for the
		    command invoked by that key.

     ESC X describe <command-name> CR
		Gives as local display the documentation for the extended
		   command whose name is given.

     ESC X apropos <topic> CR
	         Gives as local display a list of commands whose names
	            contain the character string given as <topic>, and
	            tells what keys invoke them, in the current buffer.
		  Relevant extended commands are also listed.

     The "<" and ">"'s in the above descriptions do not mean that you should
type <'s and >'s.  They are being used as "pointy brackets".  That is to say,
"<topic>" means any character string, being some topic you want help on.
We use the "pointy brackets" so that you will not be misled into typing the
character string "topic".

     We have also learned of the "fillon" extended command:

     ESC X fillon CR
		Enters "fill" minor mode in the current buffer.  This
		   causes overlength lines to be wrapped around and broken
		   as they cross the "fill column". Ask the "describe"
		   extended command to tell you more about fill mode.


			  W__o_r_d C__o_m_m_a_n_d_s

     Some of the most useful commands in Emacs are those which relate to
words.  Even if we are typing computer programs or other non-English text
material, the facility to move around word by word, delete words, etc., is a
very useful one.

     The word movement and deletion commands have a deliberate parallelism
with the character movement and deletion commands:  ^F, ^B are Forward
Character, Backward Character, and ESC F, ESC B are Forward Word, Backward
Word.  Similarly, ^D and # are Delete Character and Rubout Character, while
ESC D and ESC # are Delete Word and Rubout Word.

     A "word" in Emacs consists of an unbroken string of upper and lower case
alphabetics (a-z and A-Z), underscores and backspaces.  For instance,
"new_payroll" is a word, "_b_e_g_i_n" is a word, "delete-char" is two words, and
"segname$entry" is two words.  "March, I said." is three words.

     The "Forward Word" command (ESC F) moves the cursor forward over one
word.  If the cursor is currently on a character that is part of some word,
the cursor will be moved to the first character after that word.   For
instance, if the cursor is on the "e" of the word "Yes" in the fragment

     "Yes, it is true," he said.

and the Forward Word (ESC F) command is issued, the cursor will be left
positioned on the comma after the word "Yes".  If the cursor is now on a
character between two words (even if they are separated by many blank lines,
or many lines full of punctuation, breaker bars, etc.), Forward Word will
position the cursor to the first character after the _n_e_x_t word in the buffer.
Thus, if the cursor is on the comma after the word "Yes" in the above example,
and the Forward Word command is issued, the cursor will be moved to the space
after the word "it".

     Moving around by words is often the fastest way, or the most convenient
way to move the cursor to where you want to go from where you are.  It is
quite common to type ESC F ESC F ESC F etc. to move a word at a time, watching
the cursor.  You might also judge "I want to go six words forward, roughly",
and issue the key sequence

     ESC 6 ESC F

which is allowed, because Forward Word accepts a numeric argument as
a repetition count.  However, doing ESC F's one at a time to move forward
word-by-word is still an often-needed technique.  There are some problems in
that technique, however, because any slip-up in typing

     ESC F ESC F ESC F ESC F

and you may have

     ESC F ESC F ESC ESC F F ESC F

or similar, which is not what you want.  (If, by the way, you fall into this
trap, and ESC ESC gives you "Eval:", do a ^G to get out of it.)  Therefore,
the command Re-execute Command (^C) is provided to make this and similar
operations easier and less error-prone.   Typing a Control C re-executes the
last editor keystroke command entered.  Thus, after typing ESC F to go forward
a word, each typing of the single keystroke ^C will go forward another word.
With good system response, this can be very effective.

     To go backward by words, Backward Word (ESC B) is provided.  It is
similar to Forward Word, and most other Emacs forward/backward motion
commands.  If the cursor is on some character of a word, other than the first
character, it will be moved to the first character of the word.  If on the
first character of a word, or between words, Backward Word will move to the
first character of the previous word (i.e., further back in the buffer).
If we have the fragment

     He said, "Come, let us reason together."

and the cursor is on the "e" of "let", Backward Word would move it to the "l"
of "let".  Successive Backward Word's would move it to the "C" of "Come",
the "s" of "said", and the "H" of "He".  ^C (Re-execute Command) may be used to
repeat Backward Word (or any other Emacs command) in the same way as we
described for Forward Word.

     Here is a good example of the interaction between Forward Word and
Backward Word.  To put parentheses around the sobriquet "Tony" in

     Anthony Tony Burns.

assuming that the cursor is at the "." after "Burns", we type

     ESC B ESC B

to put the cursor at the "T" of "Tony. Then we type an open-parenthesis, which
inserts itself at the cursor, leaving us with

    Anthony (Tony Burns.

and the cursor still on the "T" of "Tony", which has now moved over.
Now ESC F puts the cursor on the space after "Tony", and typing the close
parenthesis finally gives us

     Anthony (Tony) Burns.

with the cursor on the space after "(Tony)".  The total keystroke sequence
was

     ESC B ESC B ( ESC F )

How easy.

     Deleting words is perhaps the second most common editing operation (after
deleting characters) when entering text.   Most often, we type a word, and
decide that we did not want that word, or mistyped it sufficiently thoroughly
that we wish to retype it entirely.  We wish to delete the last word we typed,
which is to say (note the similarity to the use of #), the  word to the left of
the cursor.  Parallel to #, ESC #, Rubout Word, is used for this purpose.  It
deletes the word, or what is left of a word, if the cursor is in the middle of
a word, to the left of the cursor.  Its action can best be described as though
it were doing

	^@	Set the Mark
	ESC B	Backward Word
	^W	Wipe Region

That is to say, Rubout Word does a Backward Word, and removes all text between
where the cursor winds up and where it started.  Successive Rubout Word's
remove words farther and farther back.   Like all deleting commands (other
than character deleting), Rubout Word participates in kill-merging, which is
to say, that after one or any number of successive words have been removed by
Rubout Word, a yank (^Y) will get them all back.  If successive words, and the
punctuation and whitespace between them, are deleted by Rubout Word, a single
Yank command will get back the whole deleted area, intact, punctuation,
whitespace, and all, as it initially stood.  Rubout Word accepts a
numeric argument as a repetition count, and, like all commands, can be
repeated with ^C.

     Note that when issued in the middle of a word, Rubout Word will delete
that part of the word to the left of the cursor.  If immediately after a word,
it will delete only the characters of the word.  At any other point, it will
delete all characters between the cursor and the previous word, and that word.
All these facts follow from the definition given above.

     Forward word deletion may be performed by Delete Word, invoked by ESC D.
It deletes the word, or part of a word, to the right of (including the
character at) the cursor.  It deletes forward, from the point where the cursor
is, to the point where Forward Word, ESC F, would go.   Successive ESC D's
will participate in kill-merging, and delete text word-by-word, all capable of
being retrieved in one Yank (^Y).  If issued with the cursor on the first
character of a word, Delete Word will remove the entire word.  If issued in
the middle of a word, Delete Word will remove all the characters from the one
at the cursor up to and including the end of the word.  If issued between
words, it deletes all whitespace and punctuation up until the next word, and
the next word along with it.  Consider the sentence

     We have not any melons today, Mrs. Johnson.

with the cursor under the "r" of "Mrs.". To replace "melons" by "pears",
we type

     ESC B ESC B ESC B


to put us on the "m" of "melons", and the ESC D, to delete the m, e, l, o, n,
and s, leaving us with

     We have not any  today, Mrs. Johnson.

with the cursor on the second of two spaces between "any" and "today".  We
then type the word "pears".

     A unique set of capabilities is provided by three commands which control
the "case" of words, i.e., lower case ("jack"), upper case ("JACK"), or
"Capitalized Initial", ("Jack").   These three commands are:

     ESC L	Lower Case Word
     ESC U	Upper Case Word
     ESC C	Capitalize Initial Word

     Each of these commands may be issued with the cursor _o_n a word, that is,
on any character of it, or _i_m_m_e_d_i_a_t_e_l_y _a_f_t_e_r a word to alter the case of that
word.  For instance, suppose we had just typed

     thomas

with the cursor immediately after the "s" of "thomas".  To capitalize
"thomas", we need only issue the two-key sequence ESC C, and we have

     Thomas

The cursor is always left immediately after the word whose case was
transformed.  If we wish to capitalize several words, say

     thomas alva edison

we can move the cursor to any letter of the word "thomas", type ESC C, leaving
us on the space after "Thomas", ^F to put us on "alva", ESC C, leaving us
between "Alva" and "edison", and ^F and ESC C one last time, leaving us after
"Edison".

     The three word-case-altering commands all leave the cursor immediately
after the word whose case is altered.  Since the character immediately after a
word is a good place from which to issue a word-case-altering command,
we can position the cursor immediately after the word "thomas", and
type  ESC C ESC L ESC U ESC C ESC L etc., and watch Thomas, thomas, THOMAS,
Thomas, thomas, etc., replace each other on the screen until we find the one
we like.  A word-case-altering command may be issued from anywhere within  a
word or immediately after it, but it will leave the cursor immediately after
the word.

     The word-case-altering commands deal with all the characters in a word,
not just the first.  Thus, a word like "MaGicAl" can be converted to
"Magical", "magical", or "MAGICAL" by use of these commands.  Thus, the
word-case-altering commands can be used to fix typos caused by holding down a
shift key too long.  For instance, in trying to type "Joralemon", we might
type "JOralemon".  An easy job for ESC C, Capitalize Initial Word.  Issuing
this command after we type the "n" gives us at once "Joralemon".

     If a word-case-altering command is issued between two words, but _n_o_t
_i_m_m_e_d_i_a_t_e_l_y after the first word, it will alter the case of, and move to the
end of, the next word.  Thus, sequences of ESC C ^F ESC C ^F, etc., will
capitalize successive words, regardless of how much punctuation or whitespace
separates them.

     Related to the word-case-altering commands are the underlining and
underline-removing commands, ESC _ and ESC -. These commands are used to
cause a word to be underlined, or to remove the underlining from an underlined
word.  It is important to note that most current video terminals either do not
have the ability to underline text at all, or can only do it in ways that are
either very limited or not useful.  Therefore, underlined text in Emacs
appears as

     H\010__\010e_\010l_\010l_\010o

where

     H__e_l_l_o

is wanted. The "\010"'s are backspaces; they are shown in this way because
almost no video terminals can overprint characters, even among those that have
limited underlining capability.  The text in the buffer, which will be written
out to your file, actually contains the proper number and placement of
backspaces: the "\010" representation is only the way they _a_p_p_e_a_r on the
screen.

     Typing in backspaces in order to underline words when talking to Multics
is confusing, difficult, and error-prone enough when using a printing
terminal:  the familiar sequence of "H e l l o backspace backspace backspace
backspace backspace _ _ _ _ _" or worse is even less convenient on a video
terminal that cannot overstrike.  

     A word can be automatically underlined correctly by use of the Emacs
Underline Word command, ESC _ (the two-key sequence, Escape Underscore.  Be
careful to remember to use the shift key to get the underscore if, on your
terminal, you would use the shift key any other time to get an underscore!) To
use this command, position the cursor to any place within a word to be
underlined, or immediately after, just as for the word-case-altering commands.
ESC _ will then cause this word to be underlined correctly, and leave the
cursor positioned immediately after it.  Just as with the word-case-altering
commands, to type in a word and underline it, say "_b_e_g_i_n", we type the seven
keys

     b e g i n ESC _

The fact that we issued the Underline Word command immediately to the right of
a word (which we had just entered) causes that word to be underlined.

     The command ESC - (Escape Minus-sign), Remove Underlining From Word,
is used to take out underscores and backspaces (i.e., de-underline) a word
that is underlined.  Like the word-case-altering commands and Underline Word,
it may be issued with the cursor at any point within  the word of interest, or
immediately after it.  Just as with the  word-case-altering commands,
successive ESC _'s and ESC -'s will add and remove underlining from the same
word, in alternation.

      As with the word-case commands, to underline successive words,

     ESC _ ^F ESC _ ^F ESC _ ^F

will do the job.

     A thoroughly unique ability of Multics Emacs is the ability to search for
_w_o_r_d_s as opposed to _s_t_r_i_n_g_s, when required.  Suppose we had the sentence

     Yes, I know, Miss Smith's theater
     is the One for _m_e!

Let us assume that the cursor was on a previous line, or in the word "Yes",
and we wanted to find the word "is".  We could use String Search, ^S, and
reply

     i s ESC

to the prompt

     String Search:

but this would get us to the "is" in "Miss", which is not what we want.
We could search again, but there is a better way.  Use of the Word Search
command, ^XW, will find a _w_o_r_d, not a part of a word.  If we had typed ^XW
when trying to find the word "is", Emacs would have prompted:

     Word Search:

We then type the word, "is", as we would have for String Search, and a
carraige return.

     Word Search can find words regardless of capitalization or underlining.
For instance, using Word Search to find the words "one" or "me" in the above
sentence would find "One" and "_m_e".  

     Word Search can also find _s_e_q_u_e_n_c_e_s of words, which is to say, several
sequential words, separated by any amount of punctuation or whitespace.  If
the cursor were far above the above fragment, in the document in which it
appeared, we could find our fragment by answering ^XW's prompt,

     Word Search: i know miss smith CR

and the cursor will be left immediately after the "h" of "Smith", for the
words:

     I know, Miss Smith

appear in sequence.  The comma between "know" and "Miss", as well as all
spaces, and the capitalization of I, Miss, and Smith, are ignored by Word
Search.  In fact, we could have searched:

     Word Search: theater is the CR

and the cursor would be left after the word "the", in the second line of the
fragment.  The newline (carriage return) separating "theater" from "is" is
simply whitespace, which is ignored by Word Search.  When we say that
whitespace and punctuation is ignored by Word Search, we do not mean that
having whitespace or punctuation  is the same as not having _a_n_y: what _i_s meant
is that any amount of whitespace or punctuation will be treated the same, as
separating one word from the next.  Thus,

     ^XW jack knife CR

will find

     jack knife
     Jack, knife
     J__a_c_k... "KNIFE!!"

but not

     jackknife

which is one word, not two.

     Word Search can also help searching by searching for words that start
with a given string.  This is useful for searching for long word.  To indicate
that a word-prefix is being searched for, we type the first letters of the
word followed by an asterisk, for example,

    anted*

to search for "antediluvian"  We can use an abbreviated word in this way as
part of a word-sequence being searched for, for example,

     ^XW the anted* era CR

to search for 

     T__h_e "A__n_t_e_d_i_l_u_v_i_a_n" E__r_a

     Word Search is clearly an extremely powerful and useful command.  Like
most other Emacs search commands, typing simply carriage return to its prompt,
i.e., a null, or empty search string, re-uses the last search string.  Word
Search searches from the current point in the buffer (where the cursor is) to
the end of the buffer, indicating the usual

     Search Fails.

with its characteristic beep if the word or words being searched for could not
be found.  There is no reverse word search; however, Word Search with an
argument, for example

     ESC 1 ^XW

will search from the beginning of the buffer to the end.  A word of caution,
however.   Because Word Search is such a powerful command that checks for so
many different occurences, it can be slow, especially on a large file, and on
a slow system.   Searching from the beginning of a file will almost always
make it slower, taking a long time.  In general, the ordinary String Search
(^S) should be used for best response if you can tell (as with other editors)
what exact characters you are looking for; use word search when you do not
know what characters you are looking for, but you do know what words.

     Perhaps the best example of a use for Word Search is the editing of an
input segment to a text justifier, like compose or runoff, when you have a
hard-copy of the output (.compout or .runoff) segment before you.  You can
use Word Search to search for a group of words that you see in the output
segment:  they will be found in the input segment, even if compose or runoff
inserted or deleted many spaces or moved them around on different lines when
filling or justifying text.

     We now summarize the various commands for manipulating words:

 Word Motion of cursor:

     ESC F	Move forward a word, to the end of the current word, or
		 (if now at the end of a word or between words) to the end
		 of the next word.

     ESC B	Move backward a word, to the beginning of the current
		 word, or (if now at the beginning of a word or between
		 words) to the beginning of the previous word.

Deleting words and parts of words:

     ESC D	Delete forward from the cursor to the end of a word.  If
		 between words, this will delete the word to the right of
		 the cursor.
		
     ESC #	Delete backward from the cursor to the beginning of a
		 word.  If between words, this will delete the word to the
		 left of the cursor.

Changing qualities of words:
     These commands apply to the word in which the cursor appears,
     or the word which IMMEDIATELY preceds the cursor:

     ESC U	Convert the word to all UPPERCASE.

     ESC L	CONVERT THE WORD TO ALL lowercase.

     ESC C	lowercase the word, and then give it
		 An Initial Capital Letter.

     ESC _	U__n_d_e_r_l_i_n_e the word.

     ESC -	De-underline _t_h_e _w_o_r_d.

Searching for words or groups of words:

     ^XW		Word Search.  Search forward for the word or sequence of
		words in the search string.  The search string is ended by
		the ESC character.
