     The latest version of Multics Emacs contains a new "menu"-type scheme to
manipulate buffers and windows, and supports as many windows as can be fit on
the screen without any window going to less than 3 lines.

     First, some definitions:

	o buffer - a body of text in Emacs identified by a buffer
	  name. This concept has not changed.

	o window - an area of the screen delimited by "boundary lines"
	  (lines of "-----"), the top of the screen, or the modeline.
	  A window is said to be displaying a buffer if the text of that
	  buffer can be seen in that window.

	o "on display in" - a buffer is on display in a given window
	  if the text of that buffer can be seen in that window.

	o topline - the boundary line on the top of a window.
	  The uppermost window has no topline.

	o bottomline - the boundary line on the bottom of a window.
	  The bottom-most window has no bottomline.

	o Selected window - the window in which the cursor now appears
	  (when not in the minibuffer).

	o Current buffer - the buffer on display in the selected window.
	  The modeline gives the name of the current buffer.

	o LRU window - the least-recently used window, i.e., the
	  window which has been the selected window least recently.

	o Previous window - the next-most recently used window other than the
	  selected window itself.  The selected window is always the
	  most recently used.


    There are several basic techniques for manipulating windows.  The simple
keyboard commands ^XO, ^X0, ^X1, ^X2, ^X3, and ^X4 may be used to create,
destroy, and select windows in a manner roughly analogous to the old use
of ^XO, ^X1, ^X2, and ^X3.  At low speed, this may be the only convenient way.
Alternatively, the "window editor" may be used.  The window editor, invoked by
^Z^W, puts up a display of the numbers, positions, sizes, and contents of all
extant windows, and allows destruction, selection, and size-adjustment of
windows by positioning to the line describing the window to be dealt with and
issuing commands.

     First we describe the simple keyboard commands, beginning with the ones
which had been used previously:

  ^X2 creates a new window on the screen, and selects that window.  If there
      was only one window on the screen, this is the same as it had been
      before.  If there are any number of windows on the screen, ^X2 will make
      one more, and select it.  The buffer placed on display in that window
      will be one whose name is constructed as "Window ## Default" (where ##
      is the window number, the top one being window 1), no longer
      "alternate".  Arguments may no longer be used to ^X2 to specify the top
      window size; the window editor must be used for this purpose.

  ^X3 Creates a new window at the bottom of the screen, but keeps the
      currently selected window selected. The name of the buffer placed in
      that window is constructed as described above.  The new window becomes
      the LRU window, so ^X4 ^X^E (command) CR will put file output in a new
      window (see below).  Note that if there is only one window on the screen
      this is compatible with what it had done before.  Again, arguments are
      ignored.

  ^X1 Gets rid of all windows except the currently selected window, which then
      grows to occupy the whole screen.  This is compatible with what it did
      before.  Getting rid of a window does NOT mean getting rid of the text
      or buffer which is on display in that window, it just means taking the
      window off the screen.

  ^XO Selects the previous window, which is the window you had last been in
      before you were in this window.  Note that this makes the window you
      issue the ^XO in the previous window, so successive ^XO's will switch
      windows back and forth like it has always done.  Selecting a window, of
      course, may potentially (and usually does) switch buffers, too.  The
      modeline always tells you what buffer is current, the cursor tells you
      what window is selected.

     The following two new commands augment the repertoire of the above:

  ^X0 (control x zero, as opposed to control x "oh".) Removes the selected
      window from the screen, giving the space it occupied to the windows
      that were on either side of it.  The previous window will become
      the new selected window.  With an argument, deletes the specified
      window (the top window is number 1).

  ^X4 Selects the LRU window.  The idea of this is to implement "Get me a
      window I haven't looked at recently for the thing I'm about to do
      (such as a ^XB or ^X^F)".  You would want to do this if you had
      several (at least 2) windows on the screen, cared about some of them,
      didn't care about some other of them, and wanted to find one you didn't
      care about to do some new thing in.

      Note that selecting the LRU window makes it the MOST recently used
      (i.e., selected).  So some other window is now LRU, and another ^X4 will
      select _t_h_a_t window.  Thus, successive ^X4's (or ^X4 ^C ^C ...)
      will cycle through all windows on the screen.

     Several Emacs commands always switch into a new buffer to present
their goods, and leave you in it. For example, the directory editor, ^X^E
(comout), which leaves you in file_output, and RMAIL (both inbound and
outbound).  Some of these commands (and this is surely an area for debate)
think they know that what you ask of them is not what you are "really doing".
For instance, send-mail (^XM) believes that when you wish to send mail, it is
on a spur-of-the-moment impulse, and you wish to keep what you were doing on
the screen.  Similarly, comout (^X^E) believes that you are looking at
file_output just to see how the "results" of your editing suceeded, and you do
not wish to obliterate what you are editing from the screen.

     These commands perform what is called a "find buffer in window" (which,
incidentally, is available to the extension programmer by that name with
hyphens in it).  What this means is that if the buffer they wish to go
to/display (e.g., "file_output" for ^X^E (comout)) is already on display in
some window, they will select that window.  If the buffer is not on display,
they will select the LRU window in which to _p_u_t it on display, and so do.  The
directory editor will put its "examine" buffer on display with a "find buffer
in window", replacing the content of the LRU window if its examine buffer is
not already on display.  Ditto the RMAIL reply buffer.

	    --------------------------------------------------

     The window editor provides an interactive way to manipulate windows in an
integrated fashion, allowing the screen to be conveniently reorganized.  The
window editor puts a formatted display in a dedicated buffer, which will
appear on the screen, in the selected window.  ^Z^W causes this to happen.  If
you want it to do a find-buffer-in-window on itself (e.g., you want to see the
effect of reorganizing the screen on the material in the selected window),
give it an argument, i.e., ^U^Z^W.  A typical window editor display looks like
this:

	1   0	0    12	term-paper	appear on 
	2*  2	13   3	WINDOWSTAT	2*  
	3   4	17   2	Messages from COMSAT

Each line speaks of the contents of one window on the screen at the time
the window editor was entered.  There are as many lines as there are windows.
You may not use normal Emacs commands to change the content of the display; it
is read-only.  You may, however, use normal Emacs commands (e.g., searches,
etc.) to position around in it.   The cursor, when in the window-editor's
buffer, is always on some line of the buffer (beware, the buffer may be larger
than the window it is in, like most Emacs buffers!).  That line speaks of some
window; the window's window-number from the top of the screen is the first
number on that line.  The window designated by the line on which the cursor is
will be called the "designated window (do not confuse this with the selected
window, which will always be the window containing the window editor's
display).

     The window number will be followed by a star for the window that was the
selected window at the time the window editor was entered.   The next number
on each line is called the "internal window number", and is usually not of
interest.  The remaining two numbers on each line are the position and size of
each window, the position being the starting line-number on the screen (the
top line is 0) and the number of lines in it.

     Following the position and size is the buffer name of the buffer
currently on display in that window.  Following the buffer name are the first
ten characters of the "point line" in that window.  The "point line" is the
line in the window that the cursor will go to if that window is selected.

     One operates the window editor by invoking it, positioning to some line,
thus designating some window, and issuing commands to affect that window.
The following requests are recognized: note that they are "printing" (i.e., not
control) characters, for ease of typing, since you may not enter text into a
read-only buffer (like that of the window-editor or DIRED).  They are:

     g     Go to, or select that window, leaving the window editor, and
	 moving the cursor to that window.   given window in a many-window
	 situation, as opposed to a large number of ^X4's.

     f	 same as g, for compatibility with the buffer editor.

     k	 Kill, i.e., remove this window from the screen.  This will be done
	 immediately, and the buffer editor display will be updated to
	 reflect the new screen layout.  The space occupied by that window
	 will be distributed among its neighbors.

     d	 same as k, for DIRED compatibility.

     ^	 (think of the shape of this character, "pushing up").  Move the
	 topline of the designated window up by one, increasing the size
	 of this window, and deducting one from its upstairs neighbor.
	 With a numeric argument, do that many lines instead of one.
	 The buffer editor display will be updated to reflect the new
	 screen layout.

     v	 (think of the shape of this character, "pushing down".)  Moves the
	 bottomline of the designated window down.  Same rules and features
	 as ^.

     a	 (think of the shape of a capital A).  Bring the topline of this
	 window down, same rules and features as ^.

     u	 (think of the shape of a U). Pull the bottomline of this window
	 up, same rules and features as ^.

     The following requests do not deal with the designated window, and may be
issued at any time in the window editor:

     n	 Go to the next line of the window editor display.  Although you
	 could use ^N as always, n is easier here, since this is a read-only
	 buffer.  If on the last line, goes to the first.

     p	 Same rationale and idea as n, except goes to the previous line (or
	 the last if issued on the first).

     b	 Exits the window editor by entering the buffer editor in the
	 window now occupied by the window editor's display.

     c	 Creates a new window (like ^X3), except leaves you in the
	 window editor's display, with the display updated to reflect the
	 new state of the screen, with the new window as designated window.

     3	 Same as c, for mnemonic ease with ^X3.

     The window editor is normally exited by selecting some other window with
the "g" request; indeed, one may often enter the window editor for no other
reason than to do this!  Once can also exit via the "b" request to the buffer
editor, or just ^XB or ^X^F of whatever one normally does to go wherever one
wants to go.  Beware of window editor windows left lying around on the screen:
while attractive and interesting, they are NOT updated dynamically by Emacs
if windows and buffers are changed around.


         %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

     The buffer editor provides a facility for cleaning out, examining, and
selecting buffers, similar to DIRED and the window editor.  Like both of these
other menu-type editors, the buffer editor creates a read-only display in a
special buffer, and selects it in a window of your choice.  Again as with these
others, printing-character requests are use to select options to deal with the
buffer whose name appears on the line with the cursor on it.

     The buffer editor is entered via ^Z^B.  It will put its display in the
window in which it was invoked.  If you want it to find-buffer-in-window itself
(e.g., it is on the screen already, or you don't want to overwrite the current
window), do a ^U^Z^B.

     Each line of the buffer-editor's display contains a buffer's name, a
pathname, if the buffer has a pathname associated with it, and possible flags.
The flags appear at the left margin, and they are:

	*  The buffer is "modified" (needs writing out)
	>  The buffer that was current when the buffer editor was entered.
	X  The buffer editor has marked this buffer for deletion.

     There may be more buffers (i.e., lines in the buffer editor's display)
than are on display in the window in which this display appears; like any
other Emacs buffer on display, ^V, ESC-V, or any other standard Emacs
technique may be used to position around in it.

     Buffers may be killed (as ^XK normally does) with the buffer editor
"k" (or "d") request.  Buffers so killed are not actually destroyed until the
buffer editor is exited via a g, w, f, q (or ^X^Q) request, at which time you
will be asked (if you have marked buffers for deletion) if you really want to
delete them (they will be listed as local display).

     The following requests are known to the buffer editor:

     n	 Go to next line (see window editor's similar request for the
	 rationale for this ^N substitute) or first if now on last.

     p	 Go to previous line (or last if now on first).

     k	 Mark the designated buffer for deletion when the buffer editor
	 is exited, move to the next line.

     d	 same as k, for DIRED compatibility.

     u	 Undelete, i.e., unmark for deletion, the designated buffer.
	 The X will be removed from the display, and the cursor will
	 be positioned to the next line.

     e	 Examine the designated buffer.  In one-window mode, this is
	 kind of worthless, you should just go there.  But with two or more
	 windows, a find-buffer-in-window is done on the designated buffer,
	 putting it on display if not already on display. A message will
	 be printed in the minibuffer about where (in what window) it
	 appears.

     These next requests cause the buffer editor to be exited: you will be
     interrogated about pending deletions if you have any:

     g	 Go to the designated buffer, exiting the buffer editor, replacing
	 its display in the current (selected) window, with this buffer.
	 This is just like doing a ^XB: as matter of fact, the buffer editor
	 may be used for just seeing what buffers there are and going to
	 one, to save typing!  This may also be useful for buffers with
	 long and complex names, like "Messages from Brzezinski".

     f	 Find-buffer-in-window the designated buffer.  Since the buffer
	 editor makes its own window LRU when it exits, if you "f"
	 a buffer not currently on display in any window, it is the same
	 as "g"ing it, replacing the buffer editor's window.

	 However, if the designated buffer is on the screen somewhere, the
	 cursor will simply be moved into that window (and thus, into
	 that buffer).  If you use multiple windows, you will find that you
	 will use "f" all the time, and will rarely use "g".

     s     Writes out, i.e., saves the designated buffer to its default
	 pathname, unmarking it as modified.

     w	 Exit the buffer editor to the window editor in the current window.

     q	 Exit the buffer editor to the buffer from which it was invoked, in
	 the current window, if it was invoked via ^Z^W, or find-buffer-in-window
	 the buffer from which you came if the buffer editor was invoked
	 by beargumented ^Z^B, i.e., was find-buffered-in-windowed
	 itself.

     ^X^Q	 Same as q.
