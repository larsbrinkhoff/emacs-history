2)  Setting pl1-mode options.
3)  Enhancements for pl1dcl (ESC-^D) request.
4)  New pl1-skip-to-dcl-column (ESC-SPACE) request.

    (ESC-^E) requests.
6)  New pl1-comment-xxx requests.
7)  Enhancements to pl1-comment-box (^XC) request.
8)  New pl1-refill-comment-box-region (^ZC) request.
9)  New pl1-line-between-procs (^ZD) request.
10) New pl1-include-file-comment-start-end (^ZI) request.
11) New pl1-compile-options option.


pl1-line-length option:
A new option called pl1-line-length controls the length of lines
generated by pl1dcl (ESC-^D) and several other requests.  The line
length is specified in terms of column positions, with a default
length of 112 columns.


Setting pl1-mode options:
Several new options have been added.  pl1-line-length is desribed
above, and others are described in the sections below.  Use ESC-X opt
to list or set pl1-mode options.  When in a pl1-mode buffer, setting
the value changes only the value for the current buffer.  When not in
a pl1-mode buffer, setting the value changes the default value
associated with all new pl1-mode buffers.  Setting these values in a
start_up.emacs segment sets the defaults for all pl1-mode buffers.


pl1dcl (ESC-^D):
The pl1dcl request has several new features.  It uses the
get_entry_point_dcl_$emacs subroutine to get the declaration.  This
subroutine first looks in one or more declaration files for the name
being declared.  These files are listed in the "declare" or "dcl"
search paths, which can be set using add_search_paths, etc.  Thus, the
user can define his own declaration files which override or add
declarations in the standard file without duplicating other entries in
the standard file.


If the name is not found in one of these declaration files, then an
attempt is made using object search rules to find the name.  If the
name is a procedure entry point, its entry parameter descriptors
(compiled into the object segment itself) are used to create a
declaration.


The declaration is then formatted according to a new pl1-mode option
called pl1-dcl-style.  This option can have the following values.


0  no formatting is performed.  The declaration appears on a single
   line with one space between tokens.
   
1  formatting similar to that of the indent command.  It assumes that
   the word "dcl" is in column 1, followed by 2 spaces and the
   name.  Lines longer than pl1-line-length are folded, being
   continued from column 11.


2  formatting similar to the experimental format_pl1 command with
   indattr mode.  It assumes that dcl is located somewhere between
   columns 1 and 10, and that the name is in column 11.  The
   declaration begins in pl1-dcl-column (a new options).  Lines longer
   than pl1-line-length are folded, being continued from
   pl1-dcl-column+5.

The default value for pl1-dcl-style is 1.


Entries in the declaration files have one of two forms.  Standard
declarations begin with a name followed by the attributes to be
associated with that name.  Folding can occur after any comma (or
after whitespace if no commas are found).  No trailing punctuation
should be given.  For example:

ioa_	  entry options(variable)
cu_$arg_ptr entry (fixed bin, ptr, fixed bin(21), fixed bin(35))
iox_$user_output ptr ext static
code	  fixed bin(35)


A second form declares abbreviations to be used in typing PL/I
programs.  They have the form

name  ==>  abbrev_value

When ESC-^D is used with such a name, the name is REPLACED by the
abbrev_value.  No reformatting occurs.  Typical abbreviations might be:

es	==> ext static
esi	==> ext static init(
fb	==> fixed bin
is	==> int static
isi	==> int static init(
isoc	==> int static options(constant)
isoci	==> int static options(constant) init(


pl1-skip-to-dcl-column (ESC-SPACE):
This new request moves the cursor to the column specified by the
pl1-dcl-column option.  If the statement already extends beyond this
column, the cursor is moved to the pl1-dcl-column on a new line
following the current line.  This request is useful for indenting
attributes in declare statements when ESC-^D cannot be used and
pl1-dcl-style = 2.


pl1-backward-statement (ESC-^A), pl1-forward-statement (ESC-^E):
Two new requests move forward and backward in increments of PL/I
statements.  Both take a numeric argument to indicate how many
statements to move over.


pl1-comment-xxx requests:
A new option pl1-comment-style controls how comments are handled when
text extends into the pl1-comment-column (another new option).  The
pl1-comment-column defaults to column 61.  If text extends beyond the
comment column when one of the line comment requests is given, then
the placement of the comment depends upon the pl1-comment-style.


pl1-comment-style can have the following values.

1  Comment is place on the current line following the text.

2  If text extends beyond pl1-commnt-column + pl1-comment-column-delta
   (a new option), then the comment is placed on a new line below the
   current line.  Otherwise, it is placed on the current line.  The
   default value of pl1-comment-column-delta is 10.
   
3  Comment is placed on a new line following the current line.
   
The default value for pl1-comment-style is 1.


The following comment requests observe pl1-comment-style.

ESC-;	pl1-comment-current-line
ESC-N	pl1-comment-next-line
ESC-P	pl1-comment-prev-line

ESC-N and ESC-P take a numeric argument to indicate how many lines
forward or backward the cursor should move before commenting the line.


A new pl1-comment-end (ESC-*) request moves the cursor to the end of
the line (according to the pl1-line-length option) and places a
comment suffix (*/) at the end of a comment line.


pl1-comment-box (^XC):
This request has been significantly enhanced.  When a new comment box
is created, fill-mode is entered to facilitate typing of prose text.
The pl1-line-length is used to control the filling of comment lines.
When a subsequent (^XC) is entered to exit comment minor-mode, the
comment box is completed by placing comment-suffix (*/) at the ends of
all box lines.


Fill-mode can be exited and re-entered during the creation of a
comment box using 
  ESC-X filloff
  ESC-X fillon


If (^XC) is typed to enter comment minor-mode while the cursor is
positioned inside an existing comment box, then new comment lines are
inserted above the line on which the cursor is positioned.  Filling
occurs for only the new lines.  The old lines remain unchanged.


pl1-refill-comment-box-region (^ZC):
This new request complements the enhancements made to the
pl1-comment-box request.  It refills the comment box lines between
(and including) the lines containing the cursor and the-mark.


pl1-line-between-procs (^ZD):
This new request generates a dividing line between major blocks of
code in a PL/I program to provide visual separation of the code.  A
line of the form:

/*  *  *  *  *  *  .... *  */

which extends through the pl1-line-length column.  If the cursor is
positioned at the beginning of a dividing line, ^ZD causes a new
divider plus a newpage to be inserted.  Similarly, ^U^ZD causes a
divider, a new page and another divider to be inserted.


pl1-include-file-comment-start-end (^ZI):
This new request generates a starting and ending comment line for PL/I
include files.  The lines have the form:

/* START OF:	xxx.incl.pl1	*  *  *  */

/* END OF:	xxx.incl.pl1	*  *  *  */


New pl1-compile-options option:
The pl1-compile-options option can be set to specify the default
compilation options used by ESC-^C to compile the program.  The
default compiler option is "-table".

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
