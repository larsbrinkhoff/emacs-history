	Multics  Emacs  is  a  display-oriented text-preparation and editing
facility  modelled  after  the  EMACS editor of  R. Stallman and others on the
MIT AI Lab's PDP-10.

	The  pathname  of Multics Emacs is >unb>emacs.  The normal
arguments  to  the  emacs command are the pathnames of files to be read in and
edited.  The command has the added names multics_emacs and e.

	This info segment contains basic information about accessing Multics
Emacs,  and  the  most  fundamental  information about its use.  For a list of
editor  commands  available in the default environment (Fundamental Mode), see
fundamental-mode.info  in  this  directory.  The reader should be aware of the
following documents in >doc>ss>emacs;  you should obtain a copy
of fundamental-mode.info if you have not already.  Most of these documents are

and  Phoenix System M.  If you wish to be put on these mailing lists, or taken
off, please send mail to either of the above addresses.

	Invoking  the  emacs  command  places  you  in an editor buffer named
"main".   Text  may  be  typed  immediately:  it goes directly into the buffer.
The  carriage-return  key  is  used  to terminate lines.  The cursor of a video
terminal,  or  the  print  head  of  a printing terminal, shows the place where
text  will  next  go.  The cursor (or print head) corresponds to a point in the
buffer  known  as  "point".   "Point"  moves  around  as  characters are typed.
Point  may  be  moved  explicitly  by  "editor  commands",  which are issued by
typing   either   single  "control"  characters,  or  two-character  sequences.
Commands  exist  to  move  point over words, paragraphs, characters, sentences,
etc.,  forward  and  backward  one  or  many  times.   Commands exist to delete
characters,  words,  sentences,  etc.,  and  to  retrieve  or rearrange text so
deleted.   Various  sets  of  commands are available to deal with various types
of  editing  tasks:   the  file  fundamental-mode.info  tells what commands are
invoked by what keys, and what they do.

	"Control"  characters  are  entered  by  holding  down the key marked
"CTL",  "CTRL",  "CNTRL",  "CONTROL",  or the like, and pressing some other key
(say,  "N",  to  get a "Control N") while the "CONTROL" key is being held down;
it  is  like a "shift" key.  In some cases, although not for letters, it may be
necessary  to  hold the CONTROL and SHIFT keys to get some characters.  Control
characters   are   represented   by  the  circumflex  character  in  all  Emacs
documentation:   "^N"  means  a  "Control  N", i.e., the character generated by
depressing  the  "N"  key  while  the  "CONTROL"  key is being held down.  Many
Emacs  commands  are invoked by 2-key sequences whose first key is the "ESCAPE"
key;   this  key  is often marked "ESC", "ALT", or "ALTMODE".  It is denoted by
"ESC"  or  "esc"  in  the  documentation.  The "ESC" key generates a character;
it  should  be  depressed  and  released  like any other key.

	In  this  document, and  all the  Emacs documentation, "CR" means the
"carriage  return"  key.   "\177" means the "DEL" or "RUBOUT" key.  "TAB" means
the  "TAB"  key;   if your terminal does not have a "TAB" key, "Control I" will
do as well.

	There  is  an  automatic documentation feature in Emacs;  to find out
what  any  key  does, depress and release the ESC key, and type a question mark
(i.e., type the TWO KEYS in order, ESC and ?).  Emacs will then prompt:

     Explain Key:

Then  type  the key or key sequence (for instance, a Control N) about which you
wish   to   find   out.    Emacs   will  display  (or  print)  the  appropriate
documentation  automatically  (it  may take a little time to find it, however).
When you resume editing, the documentation will be removed from the screen.

	"Point"  is  considered  to  be between two characters;  it is to the
left  of  the  blinking  cursor.  Newline characters at the ends of lines count
as  one  character  each,  as do tabs, backspaces, and other control characters
in  the  text (all control characters other than tab and linefeed are displayed
in the  usual  Multics  octal  escape  format,  e.g., \032).

	Emacs  will often prompt for information such as search strings, file
names,  buffer  names,  etc.,  in an area at the bottom of the screen (or on an
indented  line  on  a  printing  terminal)  called the "minibuffer".  This is a
little  buffer:  one  can  edit it, for example, use the familiar "#" to delete
unwanted  characters  as  a  regular  buffer.   Responses in the minibuffer are
almost  always  terminated  with  the  Carriage  Return  key.  To get out  of a
minibuffer  at  any  time  without executing the command, type two Control G's.
The terminal will beep, and the minibuffer command will be aborted.

	Only  the  most  common  commands  are  invocable from one-or-two key
sequences;   other  commands,  known  as "Extended commands" must be invoked by
their  full  name.   In  order  to  invoke  an  extended  command, type the two
characters  ESC  and  X:  Emacs will propmpt in the minibuffer for the name and
arguments  of  the  extended  command.   Type  them, and a carriage return.  To
obtain   the  documentation  for  any  extended  command,  use  the  "describe"
extended  command.   Type,  ESC, X, describe, a space, the name of the extended
command  you  wish  to  find  out  about, and a carriage return.  For instance,
type

	ESC X describe speedtype CR

to learn about the "speedtype" command.

	The  "apropos"  extended  command  can  be  used to find all commands
(and  what  keys  invoke  them)  that  "mention"  a particular subject in their
command-names.   This  can be used to find what command you want when you don't
know  what  key  invokes  it.  Type ESC X describe apropos CR to find out about
it.

	Many  commands  can  be  repeated  many times automatically by giving
them  a  "numeric  argument".   This is done by typing ESC, the number desired,
and   then  the  basic  command.   For  instance,  ^D  (Control  D)  deletes  a
character.   ESC  3  ^D  deletes  three  characters.   Other  commands  use the
presence  or  value  of  a  numeric argument to perform alternative actions, or
modify  their  actions:   this  is  documented  in  the  documentation  of  the
individual  commands.   A  brief list of commands that accept numeric arguments
appears below.   Negative arguments can be supplied by typing a  minus sign (-)
after ESC;  negative arguments generally cause "backwards action", for instance
going backward by screens instead of forward.

	Single-character   commands   usually  deal  with  spacing  over,  or
otherwise  manipulating  characters  or lines.  Two-keystroke commands starting
with  the  ESC key usually deal with words or sentences, often parallelling the
single-character  commands  (example, Control D is delete a character, ESC D is
delete   a   word).    More  uncommon  commands  start  with  "prefix"  control
characters:   for  instance,  Control  X Control F reads in a file.  Characters
need  not  be  shifted  (upper  case)  when  entered  after  ESC  or  a  prefix
character.

	Here  is  a list of very few simple commands.  To find out more about
any of them, use ESC ?  as described above:

	^X^F	Find, i.e., read in a file.

	^N	Go to the next line.
	^P	Go up to the previous line.

	^A	Go to the beginning of the line.
	^E	Go to the end of the line.
	^F	Go forward a character.
	^B	Go backward a character.

	ESC-<	(Escape Less-than) Go to the beginning of the buffer.
	ESC->	(Escape Greater than) Go to the end of the buffer.

	^S	Search forward.  CR ends the search string.
	^D	Delete a character.
	#	Delete last character.
	ESC ?	Help- find info on a command.

	^X^C	Quit Emacs.
	^X^W	Write out buffer to a file.

	There  are  many, many commands.  See fundamental-mode.info.  To find
out  about  all  the  "search"    commands,  type  ^_ A search CR and so forth.
Typing Control Underscore (^_) gets you into a help facility: ^_? gets  it  to
describe what it can do.

	         ----------------------------------------

	The following commands repeat with numeric arguments:

	    ^B ^C ^D ^F ^N ^O ^P ^Q # ESC-A ESC-B ESC-D ESC-E
		 ESC-F ESC-# ESC-[ ESC-]

	    Also tells ^Y how many back to yank.
	    Also tells ^K how many lines to kill.
	    Also tells ESC-Q whether to adjust or not.
	    Also tells ^XS whether to use string or QEDX-like matching.
	    Tells ^X2 how big to make top window.
	    Tells ^XV how many lines to print.
	    Tells ESC-R how to position the cursor, and ^L the screen.
	    Tells ^X* whether to display long form, and macros how to
	    iterate.
	    Tells ^XD whether to edit the working directory or some other.
	    Tells ESC-I whether to indent to words on last line, or look up.

	-------------------------------------------------------

Here is a brief table of some common cursor motion and deleting commands:
(\177 means the "RUBOUT" or "DEL" key)

	    Forward   Backward  End-of Beginning-of Delete    Delete
					    Forward   Backward

Character	    ^F	    ^B			    ^D	    \177 or #

Screen	    ^V        ESC V     ESC99ESC R
				 ESC0ESC R

Buffer			    ESC >  ESC <
	         ----------------------------------------

	If  you  have  set  your  Multics  erase,  kill, and character-escape
characters  to  other  printing  characters  than  the usual #, @, and \, Emacs
will  use  them  for  these  purposes.  If you use the standard Multics editing
characters,  or  have non-printing characters as editing characters, Emacs will
use #, @, and \ in their usual sense.

	Emacs  attempts  to  determine  the  characteristics of your terminal
from  the  Multics  terminal  type.  If you are logged in via the ARPA network,
Emacs   will  attempt  to  negotiate  the  "Supdup  Output"  TELNET  option  to
determine  your  terminal  type.   If  the  Multics type is ASCII, or your User
Host  does  not  support  the Supdup Output option, or your Multics terminal is
not  of  a  recognized  type,  Emacs will ask you the type of terminal you have
with a question of the form:

	What type terminal do you have?

You may answer "quit" to this response to exit Emacs immediately.

	In  addition,  three  control arguments for setting the terminal type
are  recognized  by Emacs when given as the FIRST command line argument.  These
are:
   
     emacs -ttp STRING	or	emacs -terminal_type STRING
	tells  Emacs  that your terminal type is STRING.  The value of STRING
	may  be  any  recognized  editor  terminal  type or the pathname of a
	control  file  to  load.   The  terminal type given by STRING will be
	set  permanently.   IE:  changing your Multics terminal type will not
	affect Emacs' memory of this STRING.

     emacs -reset
	causes  Emacs  to  forget  any characteristics of the terminal set by
	the  -ttp  option.   Emacs will once again check the Multics terminal
	type as is the normal case.  The line speed (if set  by  -line_speed)
	is forgotten as well.

     emacs -query
	causes  Emacs  to  immediately  ask  the  user  for the terminal type
	without  checking  the  Multics  terminal type first.  The answer you
	give may be any STRING accepted by the -ttp option.

	The following control argument may be supplied to indicate  to  Emacs
your line speed.  Although Multics normally supplies this information to  Emacs
automatically,  network users  may  find  it  necessary  to  use  this  control
argument to obtain proper padding:

     emacs -line_speed BAUD-RATE
	where BAUD-RATE is the output line baud rate in bits per second.

The  -line_speed  control  argument need only be supplied once per process.  If
used,  it  must be the first control argument given, or may follow -ttp, -query
or -reset immediately.

	Emacs  looks  for a file called start_up.emacs in the home directory.
It may be full of Lisp forms, or be a compiled Lisp object segment.  It will be
loaded  (executed)  if  it  exists.   Execution of the start_up segment will be
suppressed if emacs is given the -no_startup (-ns) control argument, which must
follow all the terminal type control arguments but precede any pathnames on the
command line (or, of course, be the only control argument).

	After  the  start_up  segment  (if  any)  is  executed, the following
control arguments are processed by the "default start up":

     emacs -mc path		or	emacs -macros path
	path is a pathname.  Loads path as Lisp, like teco$macro.

     emacs -ap fun arg1 arg2	or	emacs -apply fun arg1 arg2
	evaluates (fun 'arg1 'arg2 ... )
	Valuable for constructing abbrevs.

     emacs paths
	where  paths  are  not  any of the above.  Does a find-file (^X^F) on
	each path.

	The actions of the default start up may be suppressed by the start_up
segment      if      the      latter      sets      the      list      variable
"suppress-default-start-up-execution" to t.

	Emacs   accepts  META  characters  from  AI  TV's,  and  does  TELNET
break/interrupt processing.

		         ********************

	Multics  Emacs  was  designed, implemented, and documented by Bernard
Greenberg.   William  York  has  been co-implementor.  Gary Palter designed and
implemented the current Multics file interface and "hairy search commands", the
current  internal  command  definition  facility  (defcom),  and  has otherwise
contributed  very heavily.  Richard Lamson designed and implemented the current
message  and  interrupt facility.  Many other people have contributed ideas and
suggestions.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
