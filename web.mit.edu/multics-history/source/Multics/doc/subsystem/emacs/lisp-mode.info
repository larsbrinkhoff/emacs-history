     Lisp   mode   facilitates  the  construction  and  editing  of  Lisp
programs   in   Multics   Emacs.   Commands  for  positioning  over  Lisp
expressions,   and  indenting  and  commenting  Lisp  code are available,
as  well  as commands to facilitate  the testing of Lisp programs in  the
Emacs environment.

     Lisp major mode is entered via the command

	ESC-X lisp-mode CR

or  by  Find File'ing any file with a last component name of ".lisp" when
the find-file-set-modes option is selected.  When in Lisp major mode, the
comment  column  is set to 50 (column 51), and the comment prefix to ";".
The  normal  comment commands, ESC-P, ESC-N, ESC-;, will act according to
these settings.  If lisp-mode-hook is bound, it will be called.

     The following is the current command repertoire of Lisp mode:

^I (TAB)	indent-to-lisp

	On  a  blank  or empty line,  creates enough leading whitespace
	so  that  the  first  S-expression typed on this line will line
	up  properly  according  to  conventional Lisp indenting rules.
	Normally,   this  means  line  it  up  with  the  start  of the
	previous   S-expression,   but  in  other  circumstances  other
	actions  may  be  taken.   On a non-blank line,  re-adjusts the
	line's indentation to effect conventional Lisp indenting.

ESC-Q	lisp-indent-function

	Put  point  and  mark  around  the  current  Lisp function (see
	ESC-^A).   For  all lines other than the first,  re-indent them
	according to conventional Lisp indentation.

ESC-^A	begin-defun

	Move  point  to  the  beginning of the current "function".  The
	beginning  of  a  function  is defined as right before the last
	open parenthesis at the left margin.

ESC-^B	backward-sexp

	Move  backwards  over  exactly  one balanced S-expression.  All
	comments,   quoted  strings,   and  slashified  characters  are
	considered  properly.   Will  abort  (and  beep) if unbalanced.
	AVOID  invoking  this  from  inside comments or quoted strings.
	Skips   trailing   open   parens.    Accepts  numeric  arg  for
	repetition count.

ESC-^C	compile-function

	Effects  compilation  and  loading of the current Lisp function
	via  the Multics Lisp Compiler (lcp).  Does this by loading lcp
	into  the Emacs environment  (the first  time it  is used in an
	Emacs  invocation),  utilizing  it,  and loadfiling the result.
	Will  automatically  incorporate/compile the correct version of
	e-macros.incl.lisp  into  your  environment (the first time) as
	well.   Puts  the  name  of  the  function compiled on the kill
	stack,  so  it  can  be  yanked  into an ESC-ESC minibuffer for
	trial.   Displays  compiler  diagnostics  as local display.  Be
	careful  to  WRITE  OUT  changes  you  make  and debug via this
	facility; this is a common trap: you see what you have in front
	of you "working", and you think you are done.

	Forms  ESC-^C'ed  will  be  treated  as  though  they  had been
	encountered  at  top  level by the compiler; macro definitions,
	declarations,  and side-effects from compilation to compilation
	are  all  handled  correctly.  Declarations, macro definitions,
	and    reader   macro   definitions   other   than   those   in
	e-macros.incl.lisp  must  be ESC-^C'ed explicitly.  Information
	produced during any ESC-^C stays around for all future ESC-^C's
	in  an  Emacs invocation: the regnant Emacs environment will be
	used  as  the  compile AND LOAD time environments.  Thus, macro
	and  other  definitions ESC-^Z'ed or ESC-ESC'ed are seen by the
	compiler.

ESC-^D	down-list-level

	Go  down  one  level  of list structure.  Basically the same as
	looking   forward   for   an   open  parenthesis,   but  it  is
	intelligent about Lisp comments,  quotes,  etc.

ESC-^E	end-defun

	Go   to  right  after  the  last  close-paren  of  the  current
	function.   See  "begin-defun"  for a definition of the current
	function.    Useful   to   see   if  function  balances  parens
	correctly.

ESC-^F	forward-sexp

	Skip  forward  over  exactly  one S-expression,  positioning to
	after   the  appropriate  close  parenthesis,   or  before  the
	appropriate  whitespace.   Accepts  numeric  arg for repetition
	count.   Skips  leading  close  parens.   Avoid invoking inside
	quoted strings or comments.

ESC-^H	mark-defun

	Put   point   and   mark  around  the  current  function.   See
	begin-defun for a definition of the current function.

ESC-^K	kill-sexp

	Kill  one  (or  many) S-expressions forward,  i.e.,  from point
	to   the   point   after   that  many  complete  S-expressions.
	Argument is how many.  Merges kills forward.

ESC-^M (ESC-CR) lisp-cret-and-indent

	Identical  to  a  CR  (new-line)  followed  by  indent-to-lisp;
	this  is  the  normal  way  to  terminate an input line in Lisp
	mode.   It  puts you on a new line and indents in correctly for
	the  next  S-expression.  Done in the middle of a line,  breaks
	the  line  at that point,  correctly indenting the S-expression
	which was to the right of point on the new line.

ESC-^N	forward-list

	Move  to  right  after the end of current Lisp list.  Basically
	the  same  as  searching  for  a  close paren,  but intelligent
	about Lisp comments,  quoting,  etc.

ESC-^P	backward-list

	Move  to  right  before the beginning of the current Lisp list.
	Basically  the  same  as searching backwards for an open paren,
	but intelligent about Lisp comments,  quoting,  etc.

ESC-^Q	lisp-indent-region

	Re-indent   all   lines   (other   than   the   first)  in  the
	point-to-mark region for conventional Lisp indentation.

ESC-^R	move-defun-to-screen-top

	Move  the  current function (see begin-defun for definition) to
	the  top  of  the  current  screen,   leaving point at function
	beginning.

ESC-^T	mark-sexp

	Set  point  and mark around the current S-expression.  If point
	is  currently  before the close paren of a list,  set point and
	mark  around  that  list.  If point is before whitespace,  mark
	the next S-expression.

ESC-^V	view-defun

	Print  out  current  function:   put  point and mark around the
	current  Lisp  function (see begin-defun for a definition), and
	display  it  (print  it  out  on  printing  terminals) as local
	output.

ESC-^Z	eval-top-level-form

	Evaluates  the  current  top  level form and displays its value
	in  the  minibuffer.   A top level form has the same definition
	as  a  function.   (See begin-defun for the definition).  Loads
	the  file  "e-macros.incl.lisp"  to  ensure the presence of the
	Emacs   macros.    (See  extensions.info).   This  facility  is
	intended    for    use    in    debugging    extensions, as  is
	compile-function,   but  will  run your code interpreted rather
	than  compiled  which  aids  in debugging.  Be careful to WRITE
	OUT changes you make and debug via this facility.

ESC-(	lisp-one-less-paren

	Removes  one  close  parenthesis  from  the  end  of  the  last
	S-expression  prior  to  this  line,  and  reindents this line.
	Implements  "This  automatically-indented Lisp line is indented
	one  level  too few.  There must be an extra close paren on the
	last line.  Fix it and let's see."
	
ESC-)	lisp-one-more-paren

	Adds  one close parenthesis to the end of the last S-expression
	prior  to this line, and reindents this line.  Implements "This
	automatically-indented  Lisp  line  is  indented  one level too
	many.   There  must  be a missing close paren on the last line.
	Fix it and let's see."



     The  following  extended commands invoked via ESC-X are available in
Lisp mode:

eval-buffer

	Evaluates  the  contents  of  the buffer and displays the value
	of  the  last form in the buffer via the minibuffer.  Loads the
	file  "e-macros.incl.lisp"  to insure the presence of the Emacs
	macros.   This  command is used to "load" a buffer of Lisp code
	into    the    Emacs    environment    for    debugging.    The
	eval-top-level-form  function  (ESC-^Z)  may  then  be  used to
	"re-load"  any  functions  whose  definition  you  change while
	debugging.   Be  careful  to  WRITE  OUT  changes  you make and
	debug via these facilities.

Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
