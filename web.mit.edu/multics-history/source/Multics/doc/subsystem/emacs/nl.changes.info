12/8/81 11.10 Further changes to Emacs newline handling.

An incompatible change, generally deemed to be an improvement, was made to the
definitions of the "last line" and "end of the buffer" in Multics Emacs in
Release 9.  The goal of these changes was to allow processing of files which
do not end in newline, which were not supported, and to allow searches to
search for embedded newlines.

There is a potentially dangerous effect on extension code.  This is discussed
later in this document.

This change is felt to be a correction of an earlier design bug, a major
improvement in consistency of Emacs' character handling, and compatible with
the way TECO and other character-oriented tools process text.

The essence of the change is to allow you to position your cursor BEYOND the
last newline of a file.  Previously, you could not do this (Emacs would ^G at
you tried.)  This means that if you had read in a file containing only three
lines (in 8.0 Emacs)

      First line
      Second line
      Third line

each line ending in a newline, as is usual, doing an ESC-> would put you on the
FOURTH line of the window, under the T of "Third Line".  If you then wrote this
file out, it would have been written out exactly as it was read in.

(Previously, ESC-> would have gooten you after the word "line" of the line
that says "Third line", and it will would get written out as it had been read
in).

If now (in the new scheme), you type #, the NL at the end of "Third line" will
be deleted, and the cursor will be left after the "line" of "Third line".
ESC-> will subsequently get you to this place.  If you write the file out, in
the new scheme, it will be written out WITHOUT a trailing NL, and the cursor
will remain where it is.

(This operation is impossible to describe or execute under the old scheme,
which is one of the reasons for implementing the new scheme).

The substance of the change is as follows: Emacs previously REMOVED the last
newline of a file being read in, and ADDED an extra newline to a file being
written out.  This behavior has been eliminated, nothing more and nothing
less.  The original motivation for this behavior was to put you in a "Buffer
with one line in it" when you started, and prevent people from writing out
files that didn't end in newline.

Deletion of newlines on input has been entirely eliminated.  However, it was
felt that too many users would be confused if non-newline-ending files were
allowed (in addition, many system programs do not support files that do not
end in a newline).  Therefore, there are two new options:

(1) add-newline, when On, automatically adds a newline to the buffer when
writing it out ONLY when the buffer DOES NOT end in a newline.  Default is
On.

(2) check-newline, when On, asks the user whether or not he really wishes to
write out the buffer if it does not end in a newline.  Default is Off.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Extension writers: This change does have a potentially significant effect on
all loops which process files line by line.  "lastlinep" will continue to
respond to the last line of the BUFFER, which is to say, that line whose
newline cannot be gone past, that line whose newline will never be written
out, that line that, in an empty buffer is the only line.

Suppose you have an extension that reads in some file, and does some
processing, line by line.  It might have a loop:

     (go-to-beginning-of-buffer)
     (do-forever
       (process-stuff-on-this-line)
       (if (lastlinep)(stop-doing))
       (next-line))

Previously, this worked.  Now, it will attempt to (process-stuff-on-this-line)
on the line beyond the last newline of the file, if any file was
involved at all.  This may well cause problems.  Cases and coding
techniques that will NOT have problems:

    1. Programs processing data they themselves generated, that
       did NOT put a newline: this means most cases of programs
       scanning program output today, if you think about it, because
       the only REAL change we have perpetrated is in file reading
       and writing.

    2. Programs processing files they read in that look for things
       and ignore blank lines.  All programs that look at files
       they read in should do this anyway, and be "suspicious"
       of data read in in this fashion.

Thus, we believe that most things will continue to work.  Look
over all your code, and if it is in category (2), make it suspicious
and blank-line checking.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
