     Multics Emacs LDEBUG mode (Lisp Debug) provides an
interactive Lisp environment designed for the debugging of Emacs
extension code.  Facilities are provided for tracing the Lisp
stack, breakpointing code, and interacting with the native
MacLisp "trace" facility.  LDEBUG mode is specifically optimized
for multiple-window interaction.

  LDEBUG Buffers

The heart of the LDEBUG mode facilities is the "LDEBUG" buffer.
The buffer named "LDEBUG", when created by ldebug-mode
(either in response to a breakpoint being executed, a trapped
Lisp error, or the explicit "ldebug" extended command)
evaluates any Lisp form typed into it when Carriage Return is
struck after it. The form must be all on one line- an error will
occur if the form has syntactic errors (e.g., miscounted
parentheses).  The result of the evaluation is placed in the
LDEBUG buffer on the next line, following the sign "=>", which
indicates the result of such an evaluation.  The Lisp variable
"*" will be set to the result of each successive evaluation,
as at raw Lisp top level: this may be used to reference the last
printed result.

     Random Lisp forms such as "(+ 2 3)" or "current-buffer" can
be typed at LDEBUG buffers, and the resulting buffer contents
will in effect be a dialogue of an interaction with Lisp.  Such
buffers are often dprintable for later perusal.   The values of
variables may be set by evaluating the normal Lisp setq form,
e.g., (setq var (+ foo 27)).   As lines are
placed into the LDEBUG buffer by the LDEBUG facility, the
window (if any) containing it will scroll if necessary.

     Lisp values "printed" into the LDEBUG buffer are by default
limited in length to ten and depth to six.  The values of the
option variables "ldebug-prinlength" and "ldebug-prinlevel"
may be set to alter these defaults.  The default input and output
radices are both 8: these may be altered as the option
variables "ldebug-ibase" and "ldebug-base".

     Most Emacs requests can be used in LDEBUG buffers; they are
in "Lisp Debug" mode, which is an extension of ordinary Lisp
mode, with commands differing as detailed below.


     Emacs and Lisp Debug Mode

     The "ldebug" (ESC-X ldebug CR) extended command can be
invoked at any time, in the normal way Emacs extended commands
are invoked.  It places Emacs in the LDEBUG buffer as described
above, but also, more significantly, it sets up a system of Lisp
error handlers "under" a new invocation of the Emacs request
loop.  Should any Lisp error happen while these handlers exist,
the LDEBUG buffer will be entered, placed on display if not
already on display, the terminal's bell will be feeped, and the
Lisp error message will be entered in the LDEBUG buffer.  You
will then be at a "second (or greater) level" of LDEBUG, similar
to what happens at Multics Command level when an error occurs.
The level number will be part of the message entered in the
LDEBUG buffer.

     Recursive (level greater than 1) LDEBUG buffers may be
released (aborting all executing code between the LDEBUG level
being released and the previous level) via the ESC G
(ldebug-return-to-emacs-top-level) request, the analogue
of the Multics "release" command. It will beep and type "$g"
in the LDEBUG buffer.  The value of the variable "ldebug-level"
tells the current level of LDEBUG buffers.

     ESC P (for proceed) is the analogue of the Multics "start"
command; there is more to know about its meaning for each
different type of entry to an LDEBUG buffer, and this
will be described below.  In general, it restores the
buffer and window from which the LDEBUG buffer were entered.


     Error trap entries to LDEBUG

     When an "error trap entry" to the LDEBUG buffer has
occured, the Lisp stack may be traced via the ESC-T
(ldebug-trace-stack) request, and the value of variables may be
inspected simply by typing their names (as they are Lisp forms)
at the LDEBUG buffer.

     A value may be "returned" to the Lisp error handler by
typing it on a line, and instead of ending the line with
carriage return (which would evaluate and "print" the result),
end it with ESC P.  Note that Lisp error handlers often want a
list of the value to replace some erroneous value.  For
instance, in the following dialogue, an LDEBUG trap was entered
because of the unbound variable "stuff": the programmer returned
the symbol "value-i-wanted" as the intended value of the unbound
variable:

   (myfun huff stuff)

   Lisp breakpoint unbnd-vrbl at level 1 in buffer LDEBUG:
   lisp: undefined atomic symbol   stuff

   ('value-i-wanted)$p

All "correctable" Lisp error breakpoints will accept a "retry"
value to be used to retry the failing operation; the undefined
function breakpoint ("undf-fnctn") also accepts a list of a new
value, in this case a function to be used instead.  The MacLisp
manual must be consulted  for the exact format of other retry
values.

     The "$p" is always printed by ESC P, to remind the user of the $p
which is used in raw Multics MacLisp to restart breaks (the "$p"
is in fact derived from ESC P on the ITS operating system, which
is used to restart jobs in general).

     ESC P may also be used alone on a line (i.e., no value to be
returned preceding it) to restart a break and let Lisp's default
action occur.

     ESC G may be used as usual to release a level of errors to
the next lower LDEBUG level; note that ^G (command-quit) only
does not release past LDEBUG levels.


     Code Breakpoints

     Breakpoints may be set in interpreted extension code being
debugged by typing ESC & in a Lisp Mode buffer with the cursor
pointing at the point in some function being debugged where you
would like this break set.  The LDEBUG mechanism will create
this breakpoint by putting a call to a tracing function ("%%")
in the code in the buffer, and evaluating the function
definition it is looking at.  This "break code" will be left
in the function to let you know that it is there: it includes
a "break number" (they are assigned sequentially) by which
this breakpoint can be referred to by requests yet to
be described.

     You should be in at least one level of LDEBUG buffers
before setting a break: this means that you should have said
"ESC X ldebug CR" some time before setting breaks.

     Having set a break, you can run the code being debugged.
When the breakpoint is entered, the LDEBUG buffer will be
entered, at a new, higher level.  A message of the form

   Break 4 in function testfun

will be put in the buffer, and the LDEBUG buffer will be put on
display if not already on display. As in all LDEBUG buffers,
arbitrary forms can be evaluated (including inspecting
variables), and ESC T can be used to trace the Lisp stack.
Again, ESC G releases a level of LDEBUG buffers.

     ESC P is used to restart code breakpoints, as well. A given
breakpoint can be set for some number of proceeds (i.e., "3" means
proceed, and proceed this breakpoint the next two times it is
encountered automatically) by giving that number as a numeric
argument to ESC P (i.e., ESC 3 ESC P).  A message indicating the
number of proceeds will be inserted in the LDEBUG buffer.
ESC P should be used alone on a line (i.e., no "retry value")
when restarting code (or trace) breaks.

     When in a code break, ESC R (ldebug-reset-break) may be
used to reset the current breakpoint, before restarting or
releasing.  The break code will be removed from the function
definition (visibly, if it is on display), and the function
definition will be reevaluated.  ESC R with a numeric argument
can be used to reset a break by number.

     When in an LDEBUG buffer, ESC L (ldebug-list-breaks) may be
used to list all the known code breakpoints: their numbers, the
function in which the break appears, the buffer the function
appears in, and the status of the break.

     The source for the current breakpoint may be shown by
issuing the request ESC S (ldebug-show-bkpt-source).  It is
placed in an available window (if in multiple windows or
pop-up-window mode), and the cursor moved to the break code.
(use ^XO to get back, or in one-window mode ^XB CR).

     A common need during function breakpointing is to determine
where the editor was (i.e., what was the current buffer, and
where was the current point) at the time the breakpoint was
encountered.  The ESC ^S (ldebug-display-where-editor-was)
request serves this need; it selects the appropriate buffer,
moving the cursor to the point in it where the current point was
when the breakpoint was taken.  If the buffer is already on
display in some window (or pop-up windows are being used),
that window will be selected (i.e., receive the cursor), and ^XO
can be used to return to the LDEBUG buffer for further probing
or restarting.  In one-window mode, the correct buffer will
be switched to, and ^XB can be used to get back.
Note that if the cursor (current point) is moved
by you explicitly (i.e., via normal Emacs requests) while
visiting the buffer where the breakpoint was taken, it will have
its new position when the breakpoint is restarted.  This is
analogous to setting a variable before restarting with usual
Multics debugging.

   Using two or three windows to contain the LDEBUG buffer, the
breakpoint source (function being debugged), and the buffer the
functions being debugged are working on is highly effective and
recommended.


     Function tracing with LDEBUG

     The standard MacLisp trace package can be used while in
Emacs; extensibility features of the former allow LDEBUG to
take control of the trace output and breakpointing provided by
it.

     All the facilities of the standard trace package can be
used, by invoking trace from ESC ESC minibuffers.  The trace
package allows tracing of entries and exits to functions,
arguments, and return values, and breakpoints when functions are
entered.  Some sample forms to trace the function "testfun" are
given here: these are the in Lisp syntax, and may be typed as
such to LDEBUG mode.  When typed to an ESC-ESC minibuffer, the
outer set of parentheses should not be supplied.

       (trace testfun)	Trace the input arguments and
			return value of testfun each time
			it is invoked.

       (trace (testfun break (< x 3)))
			Trace input and return value of
			testfun, enter a breakpoint when
			entered and x (x can be an argument
			to testfun) is less than 3.
       (trace (testfun break t))
			Same, but breakpont at every
			entry to testfun.
       (trace (testfun entry (a b) exit (c)))
			Trace input args and return value,
			also print out the values of a and b
			when testfun is entered and the value
			of c when it is exited.

     The general syntax of trace invocations is (brackets are
indicating optional clauses, angle brackets are syntactic
variables):

     (trace <fnname-or-clause-1>  ... <fnname-or-clause-n>)

where <fnname-or-clause> is either a function name to be traced
for only input args and return value, or

     (<fnname> [break <break-condition>] [entry (<entry-vals>)]
				 [exit (<exit-vals>)])

There are other options documented in the MacLisp reference
manual.

     When a function is traced within Emacs (it is not
recommended to trace internal Lisp or Emacs primitives, and any
part of the redisplay should definitely not be traced in this
way), trace output for entry and exit tracings will be placed
(and scrolled) directly into the LDEBUG buffer if it is on
display; if it is not on display, this output will be put in the
LDEBUG buffer, AND local-display'ed as it is produced.
Note that the -- * * * * * * * * * -- of local displays will NOT
be produced, as it cannot be known when the "end" of trace
output has been reached.  Thus, traced functions invoked from
the minibuffer may often leave the cursor in the minibuffer
awaiting clearing the local display via linefeed or ^L.

     Trace output generally looks like

   (3 enter testfun (3 5 (a . b)) /|/| (4 5))

The indentation level gives the depth in currently active
traced functions.  The "3" is the recursion depth of the
given function (e.g., testfun) being traced.  "enter"
is the type of trace (enter vs. exit), (3 5 (a . b))
is the list of arguments (in this case, three arguments).
/|/| sets off the "entry values" and "exit values"
optionally selectable by the "entry" and "exit" keywords
in the trace-invoking form.   Exit traces look like

   (3 exit testfun 17)

     If trace is used to set an entry breakpoint, the LDEBUG
buffer will be trapped to at the time the traced function is
entered, in a way very much like a Lisp error break to LDEBUG.
A message such as

   Entry breakpoint to function testfun

will be "printed" into the LDEBUG buffer, and the terminal
feeped.  As with LDEBUG code breaks, ESC G releases, ESC P
restarts, ESC R resets, and ESC ^S shows where the editor was
at the time the break was taken.  When in entry breakpoints to
interpreted functions, the arguments may be inspected by name.
ESC-T may be used to trace the Lisp stack, but unless
*rset t mode was in effect (setting up an LDEBUG level does this
automatically), trace information may not be present.

     It is not necessary to have invoked ldebug before invoking
trace in Emacs; LDEBUG will be invoked automatically if an
attempt is made to use trace in Emacs.  If some critical
mechanism is being debugged and normal trace handling (i.e.,
breakpointing/tracing to user_i/o from Lisp, not the Emacs
handling just described is necessary, the variables
trace-printer and trace-break-fun should be made unbound (e.g.,
ESC ESC makunbound 'trace-printer) before the first reference to
trace in a given invocation of Emacs.
