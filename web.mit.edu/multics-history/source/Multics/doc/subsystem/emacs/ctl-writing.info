     Support of video (and printing) terminals in Emacs is accomplished
via terminal-dependent modules known as "CTL"s (from the typical name,
e.g., "super58.ctl" for a "super58" terminal).   There are about two
dozen supplied CTLs.  They are kept in the directory >unb
Emacs will attempt to locate an appropriate CTL in this directory at the
time Emacs is entered; the decision as to which CTL will be made based
upon the terminal type maintained by Multics, and optional Emacs control
arguments.

     To support a type of terminal not supported by a supplied CTL, it is
necessary to write a new CTL.  A CTL is written as a Lisp source program,
name TTYTYPE.ctl.lisp, TTYTYPE being the name of the terminal type which
will be supported.  If this terminal type is in your site's TTF (Terminal
Type File), the name chosen should appear the same as appears in the TTF,
except that the name of the CTL should be all lower case (Emacs will lower-case
terminal types when looking for CTLs).  

     CTLs are usually written by example from supplied CTLs.  Personnel
with no knowledge of Lisp at all have achieved this successfully.  A
relevant introduction to Lisp may be found in extensions.info in the Emacs
documentation directory.  Once the CTL is written, it must be compiled
before it can be used.  Compilation is performed via the Lisp compiler, lcp,
which is kept in >unb.  A typical command line to compile
a CTL might be

	lcp super58.ctl

This will produce an object segment, super58ctl, which, when debugged, can be
installed in the system library.  To use a CTL being debugged, invoke
emacs with the "-ttp" control argument and the full pathname of the
_c_o_m_p_i_l_e_d CTL:

	emacs -ttp >udd>Support>Jones>emacs_development>super58.ctl

See emacs.info in the Emacs Documentation directory for the valid
control arguments for managing terminal types.

	    **************************************************


     The most effective method of writing a new CTL is to take one that
was written for a similar terminal and modify it.  Almost all of the extant
CTLs were written in this way.  The source for all supplied CTLs is kept
in >>ldd>unb>s>bound_emacs_ctls_.s.archive.  The sources are Lisp source
segments, generally one or two printed pages long.    Good starting points are

   o vip7200.ctl.lisp, typical of terminals that do not have the ability
     to insert or delete lines or characters.

   o vip7800.ctl.lisp, typical of terminals that do have these abilities.
     The two facilities are independent, either one, both, or neither
     may be present, although use of terminals without insert/delete
     lines at less than 300 baud may be found to be unacceptable.

     The interfaces (function definitions) in a CTL are standardized.  They
have the same names in all CTLs.  The Emacs screen manager will call these
interfaces anonymously after the appropriate CTL has been loaded.  The
interface DCTL-init is called at Emacs start up time; it has the responsibility
of setting various flags, and initializing the terminal.  It should
contain the statements

 (setq idel-lines-availablep t)    if the terminal can insert/delete lines
 (setq idel-lines-availablep nil)  if it cannot
 (setq idel-chars-availablep t)    if the terminal can insert/delete characters
 (setq idel-chars-availablep nil)  if it cannot
 (setq screenheight N.)            Where N is the number of LINES on the screen
			     (note the dot after the N).
 (setq screenlinelen M.)	     Where M is _o_n_e _l_e_s_s than_ the number
			     of characters in a line on this terminal.
			     Again, note the dot.
 (setq tty-type 'TYPENAME)	     Where TYPENAME is a word like "super58"
			     that identifies the terminal type.

     At the time DCTL-init is invoked, the variable "ospeed" is set to the
speed of the communications line in _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_s _p_e_r _s_e_c_o_n_d.
This may be used to perform padding calculations.

     Also before DCTL-init is invoked, the variable "given-tty-type" is set to
the name by which the CTL was loaded with the ".ctl" suffix stripped.  This
variable can be used in DCTL-init (and elsewhere) to enable and use different
features of a terminal dependent on the name used to reference that terminal.

     The following functions are available to the CTL writer:

	o Rtyo takes one argument, a number (fixnum), and outputs
	  that number as ASCII data. For instance, (Rtyo 141) will
	  output an "a", and (Rtyo 33) will output an ESC.

	o Rprinc takes one argument, a character string, and outputs
	  it.  For instance, (Rprinc "]I") outputs a right bracket and
	  an I.

Both of these functions buffer their output until the Emacs screen manager
deems it appropriate to dump this buffer.  This will always be done at
the end of any redisplay at all, and after DCTL-init is called.

     The CTL writer must maintain the values of the special (global) variables
X and Y as the zero-originned screen position where the cursor was left.
In return, he or she gets to inspect these variables to do positioning
optimization.

     The CTL writer must provide the following interfaces to be called by
the Emacs screen manager:

     o DCTL-init  - (of no arguments) - Must set the flags listed above,
       initialize the terminal (if necessary), clear the terminal screen,
       and leave the cursor at position (0, 0) (home).

     o DCTL-position-cursor - (of two arguments, a new X position and
       a new Y position) - Move the terminal's cursor to the given
       position, if not there already. Position 0, 0 is defined as the
       upper left hand corner of the screen.  This function must check
       the variables X and Y, and output no characters if the cursor is
       known to already be at the desired position.  Otherwise, it must
       use the values of X and Y to determine what type of motion is necessary,
       output characters to move the cursor, and update X and Y to the input
       parameters (the delay of the buffered output is not an issue).

       Typically, DCTL-position-cursor will determine which is the optimal
       movement based upon the relative positions of the cursor and the desired
       position.  For terminals that have many forms of cursor movement,
       some combination of backspaces, linefeeds, and carriage returns
       may be adequate to effect some forms of cursor movement. Sometimes
       the sequences generated by the "arrow buttons" on the terminal
       may be used for relative positioning.  Just about all terminals 
       include some form of absolute positioning.  The choice of optimal
       cursor positioning should be based upon which will output the fewest
       characters to effect the desired move.  See hp2645.ctl.lisp for an
       example of a very well optimized cursor positioner.

       One useful trick in the writing of DCTL-position-cursor is the use of
       recursion.  See adds980.ctl.lisp for an example.  If you choose to use
       terminal tabs, then your DCTL-init must set them, and you must take
       care not to clear them.  No supplied CTLs (other than the extremely
       special-case printing terminal controller) use tabs.       

     o DCTL-display-char-string (of one argument, a character string to
       be displayed).  Must output this character string to the terminal
       at the current assumed cursor position.  The string is guaranteed
       to contain no control or other non-printing characters,  and each
       character in it is guaranteed to take up one and only one print
       position.  Be careful to update cursor position after printing
       the string; the lisp function "stringlength" may be used to ascertain
       the length/printing length of the string.

     o DCTL-kill-line - (of no arguments) - Clear the line from the current
       assumed cursor position to the end of the line, and, importantly,
       _l_e_a_v_e the cursor at that original assumed position.  Most
       video terminals have a clear-to-end-of-line feature; it should be
       used here if available.  Some terminals do not, yet this function
       must be provided anyway.  The machinations for "simulating" clear
       to end of line are moderately arcane; see adm3a.ctl.lisp for an
       example of clearing to end of line by overwriting with blanks.
       Performance of this technique at 300 baud is generally completely
       unacceptable, rendering such terminals unfit for use with Emacs
       (or any other display editor) at that speed.

     o DCTL-clear-rest-of-screen - (of no arguments) - Clear the screen
       from the current assumed cursor position to the end. Leave the cursor
       where it was supplied.  Some terminals have a "clear whole screen"
       function, but not clear to end of screen.  For the time being, this
       will do, although we may use the added functionality in the future.
       If your terminal does not even have a clear-whole-screen function,
       it is probably not worth using with Emacs.  If you choose to use tabs
       in cursor positioning, be wary of clearing them via this function.

     We have just listed all the required functions.  Some terminals require
control sequences to change "modes" between normal Multics operation and
operation within Emacs.  (For example, a terminal might be switched between
line-at-a-time transmission and character-at-a-time transmission.)  Yet other
terminals might use features during the operation of Emacs which should be
disbaled/reset when using Multics.  (For example, the VT100 uses "scroll"
regions to simulate insert/delete lines.  However, if a scroll region exists,
it will make parts of the screen unusable when using Multics.)  It is possible
and quite common to switch between Multics and Emacs by using the ATTN key and
the "pi" command.  In this case, the terminal will be in the wrong mode at
various times.  If the terminal for which you are writing a CTL exhibits this
behavior, you should add the following statements to DCTL-init:

 (setq DCTL-prologue-availablep t) to specify that certain functions must be
			     performed each time Emacs "mode" is entered
			     from Multics "mode".
 (setq DCTL-epilogue-availablep t) to specify that certain functions must be
			     performed each time Multics "mode" is
			     entered from Emacs "mode".

In addition, you must then supply the following two functions:

     o DCTL-prologue - (of no arguments) - Perform any operations which are
       required when Emacs "mode" is entered from Multics "mode".  This
       function will be invoked immediately after DCTL-init is called and
       after Emacs is reentered after a QUIT via either the "pi" or "start"
       commands.

     o DCTL-epilogue - (of no arguments) - Perform any operations which are
       required when Multics "mode" is to be entered from Emacs "mode".  This
       function will be invoked immediately before Emacs is exited when the
       ^X^C (quit-the-editor) command is invoked and immediately before Emacs
       is suspended when the ^Z^Z (quit) command is invoked or the ATTN key is
       hit on the terminal.

     If you have stated that insert/delete lines is available, via setting the
flag idel-lines-availablep to t, you must supply the following two functions.
If you set this flag to nil, you need not write these functions:

     o DCTL-insert-lines - (of one argument, a number of lines to be
       inserted) - Open up the given number of lines on the screen.
       There will be guaranteed to be that many blank lines (created by
       DCTL-delete-lines) at the bottom of the screen at the time this
       function is invoked.  The cursor will be at position 0 of some
       line at the time DCTL-insert-lines is invoked.  It must push
       the contents of that line "down" the supplied number of lines,
       leaving the cursor in the same place, the line the cursor is on
       and the n-1 succeeding lines blank.

     o DCTL-delete-lines - (of one argument, a number of lines to be
       deleted) - Delete from the screen the supplied number of lines,
       starting with the line the cursor is on on down.  The cursor is to
       be left in the same place it was given.  That many blank lines
       will be assumed to be pulled up on the bottom of the screen.

     If the flag idel-chars-availablep is set t, indicating that insertion
and deletion of characters is available, the following two functions must
be supplied:

     o DCTL-insert-char-string - (of one argument, a character string
       to be inserted at the current assumed cursor position).  The
       character string supplied is to be inserted at the current
       cursor position.  All characters at, and to the right of the
       current cursor position are to be pushed over to the right.  There
       will be guaranteed to be only blanks on the screen in the region
       which will be "pushed off".  The cursor is to be left (and updated
       as being at) the end (after the last character) of the string inserted.

     o DCTL-delete-chars - (of one argument, the number of characters
       to be deleted). The supplied number of characters, starting with the
       character at the cursor and on to the right, are to be physically
       deleted from the screen.  All characters to the right of these
       characters are to be moved that many positions to the left.  That many
       blanks will be assumed to be moved in from the right edge.  The cursor
       is to be left where it was supplied.

     Writing a CTL usually involves editing an existant one, trying it,
modifying it, and iterating until it is solid.  One will use the "-ttp"
control argument many times to switch back and forth between "printing
terminal mode" and the new CTL when logged in from the terminal on which the
CTL is being developed.  For terminals with insert/delete features,
it may be convenient to debug the CTL first without these features (claim
they are not there in the DCTL-init), and add them later.  Similarly,
one is encouraged to write "more optimal" DCTL-position-cursor's once
one has one that works at all, for the convenience of editing the CTL with
Emacs substantially reduces the effort of improving it.

     For some terminals, padding may be necessary for some operations at some
or all line speeds.  If terminal behavior appears random, or garbage is left
on the screen after a ^L or ^K, this may be the problem.  Check the manual
for your terminal about padding requirements.  It may be convenient to define
a function called DCTL-pad, which takes a number of microseconds or
milliseconds as an argument, and issues enough pad characters ((Rtyo 0)
or (Rtyo 177) are common, check your terminal manual for what your terminal
expects) to perform this padding.  The variable "ospeed" gives the line
speed in characters per second, for use in such calculations.  Getting
the padding right may involve quite a bit of tinkering on some terminals;
one proven method in cases where padding is felt to be a problem is to specify
a very large amount of padding (e.g., a second) and cut it down until it works.
See dd4000.ctl.lisp for an example of terminal padding.

	    **************************************************

     The Lisp special forms _c_o_n_d and _d_o are used heavily in CTLs and
not documented in extensions.info.  Emacs environment macros (do-forever,
if, etc) should not be used in CTLs, thus the native Lisp forms are necessary.
Here are the descriptions of cond and do:

     (cond ((= this that) (thing1)(thing2))
           ((> a b)(second)(third) 27)
           ((< c 15)(other))
	 (t (last 5)(chance)))

means:

   "If this equals that, call thing1 of no arguments, then call thing2 of
    no arguments, and return as the value of the cond the value returned
    by thing2.  OTHERWISE, if a is greater than b, call "second" with
    no arguments, then call "third", and return 27 as a value. YET
    OTHERWISE, if c is less than 15 (all numbers octal), return the value
    obtained by applying "other" to no arguments.  If none of the above
    are true, call "last" with an argument of 5, and then return the value
    obtained by calling "chance" with no arguments."

"cond" is very much like PL/I's

    if ( .... ) then do;
         .....
    end;
    else if ( .... ) then do;
         .....
    end;
    else if ( .... ) then do;
         .....
    end;
    else do;
         .....
    end;

The format of Lisp "do" used in CTL's to iterate is of this form:

   (do VARIABLE INITIAL-VALUE REPEAT-VALUE TEST form1 form2 form3.. )

It is identically equivalent to PL/I's

   do VARIABLE = INITIAL-VALUE
      repeat REPEAT-VALUE
      while (^ TEST);

      form1;form2; ... 
   end;

which, itself, is equivalent to

     VARIABLE = INITIAL-VALUE;
l:   if TEST then go to e;
     form1;form2;...
     VARIABLE = REPEAT-VALUE;
     go to l;
e:   ;

The variable VARIABLE is locally defined inside the "do".  It may be used
in the forms inside the "do", in the "end test" TEST, and in the repeat
value REPEAT-VALUE.
