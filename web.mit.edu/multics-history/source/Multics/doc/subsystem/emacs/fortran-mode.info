     This is the second edition of EMACS Fortran mode.  This
mode is intended to aid in the construction and debugging of
Fortran programs using EMACS.  Commands are provided for
producing comment and continuation cards and for other commonly
used formatting operations.

     Fortran major mode is entered via the following command:

	ESC-X fortran-mode CR

     This mode may also be entered by Find File'ing any file
with a last component name of ".fortran" when the
find-file-set-modes option is selected.

     The current list of special commands in Fortran mode is:

CR	Carriage Return has been changed so that the cursor will
	return to column 7, rather than to column 1. This will
	also insert comment prefixes ("c     ") in the appropriate
	places. If desired, the cursor may be moved back by hand
	to delete spaces or comment prefixes.
	
^I	Tab has been changed so that a tab done in column 1 will
	tab to column 7. Subsequent tabs will tab to the normal
	places. The sequence for successive tabs is 7,10,20,30...
	
ESC-^M	Or ESC-CR ends the current line when the next line is a
	continuation. A new line will be done, unless the current
	line is blank or empty, and the prefix "     &  " will be
	inserted, leaving the cursor in column 9. This is the
	continuation for standard Fortran rather than for
	Multics.
	
ESC-;	Begins a single comment line. A new line is done, unless
	the current line is blank or empty, and the prefix 
	"c     " inserted, leaving the cursor in column 7. This
	may be used to end a line when the next line is a comment.
	
^XC	Begins a block of comments. The current line, if any, will
	be ended and a comment block header line inserted. Any
	future lines added will be prefixed by the standard
	comment prefix "c     ". This minor mode is exited by a
	second ^XC. Notice that ^X^C exits the editor. Don't miss!
	
ESC-:	Positions a fortran label. Since a line usually starts in
	column 7, this command is provided to correctly position
	statement numbers. Type the statement number, then ESC-:
	to place the label in column 1.

ESC-^C	Compile program.  The current buffer, if changed, is written
	out to its default pathname (as for ^X^S), and then
	compiled.  Compiler diagnostics are displayed, in the other
	window if in two-window mode.  The extended commands
	set-compiler and set-compile-options may be used to select
	the compiler and options to be used.
	
^X^D	Find next error. This command is used following a
	compilation in two-window mode. It scans the compiler output
	and the source buffer in parallel, pointing a simulated
	cursor to consecutive errors and placing the real cursor on
	the line referred to in the error message. This mode will
	terminate itself when you advance past the last error, when
	you do another compilation, or when you exit it by keying
	^XT. Since this mode locks the buffer used for
	compilations, you are strongly advised to exit it when you
	are finished.

'	Abbreviation expander. The two characters immediately
	preceeding the cursor when this character is struck
	are taken as an abbreviation and expanded. The
	character ' may itself be inserted by quoting it with
	\ or ^Q. These abbreviations are initially supplied:
	     in	integer		su   subroutine
	     di	dimension		co   continue
	     fu	function		re   return
	     eq   equivalence	ex   external
	     au   automatic		cn   common
	     fo   format		im   implicit
	Note that, with the exception of cn for common, all of
	these abbreviations are the first two characters of
	the word.	Other abbreviations may be defined using the
	extended command set-fortran-abbrev. 
	The abbreviations co (continue) and re (return) are very
	special.  Since these words almost always have a label
	and sit on a line by themselves, these abbreviations have
	been hacked to do an ESC-:  and a new-line, so that
	typing (in column 7)
	      123co'
	will expand to
	123   continue
	leaving you on the next line. The abbrev fo for format 
	hacks labels, but not new lines. Try them.

     In addition, several extended commands have been provided to set
various parameters. These are:

For comment blocks:	
ESC-X fortran-set-begin-comment CR     to set the begin line, and
ESC-X fortran-set-end-comment CR       to set the end line.

     Both of these commands prompt for the line in the minibuffer.
The line supplied is inserted exactly as given, and must therefore
include the "c" at the beginning. Default values for these lines are
	"c     ========================================".
These are set by buffer.
	
For compilations:
     ESC-X set-compiler compiler-name CR 
	to set the compiler to be used.  Default is "ft".
     ESC-X set-compile-options options  CR
	to set compile options.  These are given as on the
	compiler command.  The default is "-tb".  These are
	set by buffer.
	
And, for abbreviations,
     ESC-X set-fortran-abbrev abbrev expansion label eol
	may be used to define new abbreviations. abbrev must
	be a two character abbreviation that will be replaced
	with expansion. Arguments must be enclosed in quotes
	if they contain special characters, including spaces.
	The optional arguments label and eol will cause this
	abbrev to hack labels and new lines, respectively, just
	like co and re.  The label option does not require a
	label, but processes it if it is present.
	Abbreviations are defined globaly and apply to all
	buffers in fortran mode.  For example,
	ESC-X set-fortran-abbrev as "common /xyz/ y(100)" eol
	defines an abbrev as that expands to
		common /xyz/ y(100)
	and does a new-line, but does not believe in labels.


     As mentioned above, this is an early edition and there may
still be problems.  Any difficulties, comments, suggestions, etc.
may be mailed to Schauble.fso (on System M, Phoenix) for action.
(MIT-Multics and other ARPANET users continue to send bug/comment
mail to emacs.bugs at MIT-Multics as usual, they will be forwarded).
In fact, I would like to know if anyone is using this thing.

     Intended for future implementation are:

Debugging mode - Fortran debugging using probe integrated with
	the editor. For now, the recommended debugging method
	is to do a ^Z and run your program one level up.
	Return to emacs with a pi command.

	
     Any suggestions on these or other features should be mailed to
the above address.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
