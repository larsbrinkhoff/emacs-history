PL/I mode provides an automatic assistance in PL/I progam formatting in the
real-time editing context of Multics EMACS.  The basic facility provided at
this time is that of lining up untyped PL/I statements, although on a
one-for-one basis it will line up typed ones, too.

   Enter PL/I mode by issueing ESC-Xpl1-mode.  It will take a couple of
seconds to "load itself".  When in PL/I mode, which shows up on the Mode line
as "PL/I" as a major mode, the following non-default key bindings apply:

            TAB (^I)    Indent this PL/I statement properly (if not yet
		    typed in, tab out to it; otherwise, readjust its
		    indentation properly).
            ESC-CR (ESC-^M)   Like CR and TAB.
	  ESC-^C Compile buffer. Write this buffer to its default pathname
		and compile it, using the compiler "pl1" and assuming
		"-tb" for options. These may be changed with the
		extended commands set-compiler and set-compile-options.
		Highly effective in two-window mode.
		(See fortran-mode.info for more on this).
	  ESC-^D      Try to find a declaration for the entry-point whose
		    name is to the left of the cursor, and insert it.
		    There exists a library of such.
		    If the declaration is not in the library,
		    ESC-^D will attempt to figure it out from inbound
		    parameter descriptors in  an object segment
		    responding to that name.
		    error_table_$xxx can be declared by ESC-^D, too.
	  ESC-^H (ESC-Backspace) Delete 5 columns of indentation.
                    Intended for undenting END's.
	  ESC-^I (ESC-TAB) Add 5 columns of indentation.
	          Intended for asserting your own style.
	  ^X^D   (Control X-Control D) Find next error. When used after
		an ESC-^C, will search for errors and place the cursor
		on them in the source.  Highly effective in two window
		mode.  See fortran-mode.info for more information on
		the compilation error facility.
	  ^XC    (Control X-C) Start or end a comment. Text following
		this will be set off as a comment. A second ^XC ends
		the comment.

	  All the standard commentation commands (ESC-;, etc.) do the PL/I
	  thing.  Word commands (ESC-F, etc.) in PL/I mode buffers consider
	  the dollar sign to be part of a word.

     The indentation rules which are followed are such:

           Any fragment of an incomplete statement gets lined up 5 after the
start of that statement.  The statement after a DO or BEGIN gets indented 5
times one less than the number of IF's in the DO or BEGIN.  In "inding style
2", the statement after an END gets lined up 5 LESS than the END statement;
the first statement in a program gets lined up at col.  11 (Multics
reckoning).  OTHERWISE, each statement lines up with the previous one.

    There are two styles available; the default is 1, you can get 2 by saying
      ESC-Xopt pl1-inding-style 2 CR

(i.e., it is managed by the EMACS option mechanism).

 In style 1, you get;

      if x = 6 then do;
            bar = 5;
            foo = 6;
      end;

In style 1, you are expected to line the END up yourself (use ESC-^H) because
it is impossible in realtime to predict that an untyped statement is going to
be an END.  You must undent the end yourself, because the next statement will
line up with it.

  In style 2 you get

      if x = 6 then do;
          bar = 5;
          foo = 4;
          end;
     next = 17;

Obviously, emacs is happier with this, because it can figure out the next
statement after the END once you have typed it.

    There are no known bugs in the mode's PL/I parsing:  it pretentiously
claims to be able to parse any legal PL/I statement, with the following
exception:  Multi-dimensional label constants not supported (not a big
problem, multics PL/I doesnt support them either).

    There is also a minor mode called "electric PL/I mode", which can be
obtained by ESC-Xelectric-modeCR once in PL/I mode, or ESC-X electric-pl1-mode
CR.  To get it by default as your mode for PL/I programs, put the statement

	(defprop pl1 electric-pl1-mode suffix-mode)

in your start_up.emacs.  Some users have found electric PL/I mode overly
violent, so it remains an option.  It connects semicolon to a function which
automatically indents for the next statement after inserting a semicolon;  use
\;  to get a semi in without the electric action.  Also, this action is
suppressed if there is a next line, and it is not empty.  The "electric
semicolon" also moves "end"'s back for you (in inding-style 1), when you type
the ";" of the "end" statement.  (Be careful to "\" ;'s in strings, there are
problems there).  Electric PL/I mode also gives ":" electric action, i.e.,
indenting after labels.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
