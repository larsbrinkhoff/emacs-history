	K__e_y_s _a_n_d _t_h_e_i_r _b_i_n_d_i_n_g_s
		(Extended (esc-X) commands are listed at the end.)

#		rubout-char
   
   Deletes  the  previous  character  (before the cursor, which is usually the
   last  character  typed,  like  in  normal Multics.) Note that # deletes the
   character  to the left of the cursor, while ^D deletes the character at the
   cursor.
   
@		kill-to-beginning-of-line
   
   Kills all the text on the current line to the left of the cursor.  The text
   killed is saved on the kill ring, and may be retrieved with ^Y.
   
CR		new-line
   
   Inserts  a  newline  character into the buffer at the current point, ending
   the  current  line,  and starting a new one.  If entered in the middle of a
   line,  breaks  the  line  at the current point.  If the next line is empty,
   i.e.,  was  made  by a single CR or ^O, CR will just go to it, and will not
   insert  a  newline.   However,  the last empty line before a non-empty line
   will be left empty.  If there is a fill prefix (see ^X.), CR will insert it
   after any newline character it inserts.
   
ESC		escape
   
   Used  to enter two-keystroke key sequences, and to supply numeric arguments
   to  commands.   For example, to enter the esc-K command, type ESC then a K.
   To  supply  a  numeric argument to a command, type ESC, the number, and the
   command.  For example, ESC 3 ^D deletes 3 characters.
   
\		escape-char
   
   \NNN  where  NNN are 1 to 3 octal digits, inserts the character whose value
   is  NNN  into  the  buffer.  For example, \14 inserts a form-feed (^L).  \\
   inserts  a  \;  \#  inserts  a  #; \@ inserts a @.  \ followed by any other
   character  inserts  \  and  that  character  (except  \ CR, which inserts a
   newline).
   
\177		rubout-char
   
   Deletes  the  previous  character  (before the cursor, which is usually the
   last  character  typed, like in normal Multics.) Note that \177 deletes the
   character  to the left of the cursor, while ^D deletes the character at the
   cursor.
   
^@		set-or-pop-the-mark
   
   With  no  argument, i.e., ^@, sets the-mark in this buffer where the cursor
   is  now,  and  leaves it there.  The current value of the-mark, if any, and
   different than the current point, will be pushed on the mark ring.  It will
   move  around  properly if the text around the-mark is deleted.  See ^X^X to
   verify  where  the-mark is.  With an argument, i.e., ^U ^@, pops a mark off
   the  mark  ring,  and  positions  to it.  Successive ^U ^@'s will "try" all
   marks on the mark ring.
   
^A		go-to-beginning-of-line
   
   Position  to  the  beginning of the current line of the buffer.  That is to
   say, right before the first character.
   
^B		backward-char
   
   Move  backward  one  character  in  the  buffer.   Tabs,  and  the  newline
   characters  at the ends of lines count as one character.  Will command-quit
   at the beginning of the buffer.
   
^C		re-execute-command
   
   Re-execute  the  last keystroke (command), other than ^J or ^C.  If used to
   repeat  a  search, the search will be repeated with the same search string.
   Useful for skipping successive words, etc.
   
^D		delete-char
   
   Delete  the  character  to  the  right  of  the current point.  This is the
   character  on  which the cursor sits.  Move the rest of the line one to the
   right,  closing  up  the  space.   Deleting  a newline at the end of a line
   merges lines.
   
^E		go-to-end-of-line
   
   Position  to the end of the current line: that is, after the last character
   and  before  the  linefeed.   On  an  empty  line,  this is the same as the
   beginning of the line.
   
^F		forward-char
   
   Move forward one character.  Tabs and newlines count as one character each.
   Will command-quit at the end of the buffer.
   
^G		command-prompt-abort
   
   Quit  out  of  the  current minibuffer prompt if any, and ring the bell (or
   beep).  May be used to exit a minibuffer you did not intend to get into, or
   just to tell when Emacs has "caught up."
   
^J		noop
   
   Linefeed;  ignored.  See also ^L.  Good for exiting displays (such as ^X^B,
   apropos, etc.)

   
^K		kill-lines
   
   Kill  to  end  of  line,  except  when  already  at end of line, delete the
   linefeed  (merge  lines).   If  on  an  empty  line, delete it.  If given a
   numeric  argument, deletes that many lines, starting from the current point
   on the current line.
   
^L		redisplay-command
   
   Clear  the  screen,  and  display the current window of the current buffer,
   centered  about  the  current  line.  Useful if your screen is messed up by
   messages (although see accept-msgs), non-Emacs output, etc.  With a numeric
   argument,  moves current line to that line from the top of screen; ESC-1 ^L
   moves  current  line to top, for example.  With a negative argument, a line
   counting from the bottom of the screen will be used.
   
^N		next-line-command
   
   Position to the next line of the buffer.  If on the last line now, append a
   new  empty  line to the bottom of the buffer, and position to the beginning
   (and  end)  of  it.   Successive  ^N's  and  ^P's  try to maintain the same
   horizontal position.
   
^O		open-space
   
   Open  up space by putting a newline AHEAD of the current point.  Pushes all
   lines  of the buffer below the current line down one.  For instance, ^U^U^O
   will open up 16 lines.  See ^X^O to remove (extra) blank lines.
   
^P		prev-line-command
   
   Move to previous line of the buffer.  Will command-quit if on first line of
   the  buffer.  Attempt to maintain the same horizontal position.  Successive
   ^P's and ^N's will try to maintain the original horizontal position.
   
^Q		quote-char
   
   "Quote"  the  next  character,  i.e.,  insert it into the buffer literally.
   This  is used to enter control characters and other "funny" characters into
   the  buffer,  i.e.,  ^Q# to insert a pound sign.  ^Q CR, however, inserts a
   single  Newline  chaacter  (Newline  characters  separate  lines in Multics
   files.)
   
^R		reverse-string-search
   
   Reverse search.  Leave cursor positioned before matching string, don't move
   cursor  if  not found.  Prompts for search string in minibuffer, which must
   be ended with CR.
   
^S		string-search
   
   Search  for  a  character  string,  from  current  point  in buffer to end.
   Prompts  for  string  in  minibuffer, and leaves point, if search succeeds,
   after  the  matched  string.  End search string with CR.  ^SCR re-uses last
   search string.  If search fails, point will not move.
   
^T		twiddle-chars
   
   Twiddle  (transpose,  interchange)  the  last two characters typed, like, I
   like Mutl^Tics becua^Tse...  etc.

   
^U		multiplier
   
   Multiplier.   When not followed by a number, multiplies the next command by
   4  for  each  use.  i.e., ^U^D deletes 4 chars.  ^U^U^D deletes 16.  With a
   number, uses that, i.e., ^U13x inserts 13 x's.
   
^V		next-screen
   
   Display  next  screenful  of  this buffer.  Leave cursor at upper left hand
   corner of screen.  With an argument, displays that many screens ahead.
   
^W		wipe-region
   
   Wipe (kill) all text between cursor and the-mark.  Succeeding kill commands
   (like  ^K, NOT ^W) will merge killed text.  The killed text is saved on the
   kill ring, and can be retrieved with ^Y.
   
^X#		kill-backward-sentence
   
   Kill  backwards  to  the  beginning  of  this sentence: kill as much of the
   sentence   as   thus  far  typed.   Successive  kills  via  ^X#  and  other
   reverse-killing commands (e.g., esc-#) merge, and may be retrieved with one
   ^Y.
   
^X(		begin-macro-collection
   
   Start  learning all which follows as a macro, until ^X) or an error occurs.
   All commands and input between ^X( and ^X) will be remembered as a "macro",
   which can be executed by ^XE, or saved and assigned to a key by save-macro,
   and displayed by ^X*.

   
^X)		end-macro-collection
   
   End  a macro definition.  The commands and input typed since ^X( become the
   "last  macro  defined"  for  ^XE,  which see.  If given a numeric argument,
   re-executes  the defined macro as ^XE does (see that command).  See ^X( for
   what a macro is.
   
^X*		show-last-or-current-macro
   
   Display  the  commands  (as  keystrokes, i.e., ^A, ESC-B, etc.) in the last
   macro defined (see ^X().  If given a numeric argument, i.e., ^U^X*, display
   the keystrokes and command names.
   
^X.		set-fill-prefix
   
   Set "fill prefix" in this buffer to be whatever is between the beginning of
   the  line  and  the cursor.  The "fill prefix" is inserted automatically by
   CR,  autofill,  and runoff-paragraph.  If the cursor is at the beginning of
   the line when ^X.  is issued, the fill prefix is reset (i.e., there will be
   no fill prefix).  It may be used to establish a "left margin".
   
^X0		remove-window
   
   Removes  a  window  from  the  screen; only valid if there is more than one
   window  on  the  screen.  With no argument, ^X0 removes the current window.
   With  a  numeric argument, it removes the window specified by the argument.
   The uppermost window is window 1.
   
^X1		expand-window-to-whole-screen
   
   The  window  in which the cursor appears will be expanded to fill the whole
   screen; all other windows will be removed.  This in essence returns to "one
   window mode" from having any number of windows.  The cursor will retain its
   position in the text.  See ^Z^W.
   
^X2		create-new-window-and-go-there
   
   Creates  a  new  window  at the bottom of the screen, redividing the screen
   equally  among  the  windows  there.   The  cursor will be moved to the new
   window,  which will have a buffer name created from its window number.  See
   ^Z^W.
   
^X3		create-new-window-and-stay-here
   
   Create  a  new  window  at  the bottom of the screen, redividing the screen
   equally  among  all  the windows.  The cursor remains where it is.  The new
   window,  which  has  a  default buffer name created from its window number,
   becomes the "least recently used window".  See ^X4 and ^Z^W.
   
^X4		select-another-window
   
   The  cursor  is  moved  to the least-recently visited window on the screen.
   That  window  then  becomes  the  most-recently  visited.  Thus, successive
   applications  of  ^X4  will visit all windows on the screen.  ^X4 is a good
   command  to  use  when  you  want to visit some new buffer or file, but not
   overwrite windows containing information you have been looking at recently.
   With an argument, i.e., ESC 3 ^X4, goes to that window, e.g., window 3.

   
^X;		set-comment-column
   
   Make  the  "comment-column" in this buffer be the horizontal position where
   the  cursor  is  now..   With  an argument, sets the comment column to that
   number, counting from the left as column 1.  See esc-;.

   
^X=		linecounter
   
   Display in the minibuffer area the number of lines in this buffer, the line
   number  (the  first  line  is line 1) of the line the cursor is on, and the
   horizontal column position (on a dprinted line, not the screen).
   
^XB		select-buffer
   
   Switch  to  another buffer.  Prompts for the name of that buffer, terminate
   with  CR.   If that buffer does not already exist, it will be created.  All
   key bindings, fill column, comment column, comment prefix, etc., associated
   with that buffer will be put in effect.  The last point that you were at in
   that  buffer  becomes the current point.  ^XBCR goes to the last buffer you
   were in.
   
^XCR		eval-multics-command-line
   
   Prompt for a Multics command line.  Terminate it with CR.  Multics commands
   that produce output may well ruin your screen; if this occurs, use ^L.  Use
   ^X^E if you expect output.
   
^XD		edit-dir
   
   Enter  the  directory  editor,  editing  the  working  directory.   With an
   argument,  i.e.,  ^U^XD,  prompts  for other directory name.  Position to a
   line  with some segment's name on it, and the following commands (keys) may
   be used (lower case O.K.):

   D       Delete this segment when the directory editor is exited.
   U       Undelete, i.e., cancel previous D on this line.
   E       Examine (i.e., take a look at) this segment, in a separate
	   buffer.  Use ^X^Q to get back, and the examine
	   buffer will disappear of its own accord.
   Q       Quit the directory editor.  A list of files will be shown,
	  and you will be queried if you want to delete them
	  or not.  To exit without any action use ^XB.
   R       Rename this segment.  The new name is prompted for.
   N       Same as ^N.
   P	 Same as ^P.
   
^XE		execute-last-editor-macro
   
   Execute  the  last macro defined (via ^X( ), one or many times depending on
   the numeric argument to this command:

   No argument:	Execute it once.
   0( i.e., ESC-0^XE) Execute it over and over, pausing after each
		   execution. Type a space to go on to the next,
		   CR or ^G to stop repeating.
   1-9999		Do it that many times.
   9999-infinity	Do it forever until an error happens.
   
^XESC		escape-dont-exit-minibuf
   
   ^XESC  is  the  same  as ESC, and may be used for all ESC-...  commands and
   numeric  arguments, but may be used in the minibuffer when typing ESC would
   terminate the minibuffer, as in search strings.
   
^XF		set-fill-column
   
   Sets  the  fill  column in the current buffer to be the horizontal position
   where  the  cursor  is  now.  The fill column is the "right margin" used by
   esc-Q to fill and adjust text, by fill mode to fill and adjust text, and by
   esc-S to determine where to center.  The fill column is the first column in
   which  text  is  NOT  to  be  placed.   The new value of the fill column is
   printed out in the minibuffer.  If a numeric argument is given, e.g., ^U 72
   ^XF, the fill column is set to that value.
   
^XG		get-variable
   
   Get  back  a  "variable"  stored  by ^XX.  The name of the variable will be
   prompted for; the cursor will be put after it, and the-mark before it.
   
^XH		mark-whole-buffer
   
   Put  the-mark  at  the  end  of the buffer and the cursor at the beginning.
   This  "marks"  the  whole  buffer,  so  that  ^W  will delete it, etc.  The
   linefeed  at  the end of the buffer is NOT in the marked region, but ^XH ^W
   ^XB ...  ^Y will effectively move a whole buffer.
   
^XI		insert-file
   
   Insert  file.   Prompts  for a filename, terminated by CR.  Reads that file
   into  the  current  buffer  without destroying the previous contents of the
   buffer.   The  file  is read in to the left of the cursor and the cursor is
   left  after  the  contents of the file just read.  The default file for the
   buffer is not changed.  (See ^X^S.)

   Archive  component  pathnames are accepted.  Starnames are accepted, but no
   more than one segment or archive component can match the starname.
   
^XK		kill-buffer
   
   Kill  (destroy)  a  buffer.   Prompts  for the buffer's name.  End with CR.
   Buffers  may  be  killed  to  conserve  storage, or not to appear in buffer
   listings  or  to  prevent  quitting  (see  ^X^C).   If you kill the current
   buffer, prompts for another buffer to go to, as in ^XB.
   
^XM		send-mail
   
   Enter  the  Emacs mailer (RMAIL) to compose a letter of outgoing mail.  ^XM
   will  prompt  for the mail subject, end the subject with a carriage return.
   For full information on reading and sending mail, see rmail.info.
   
^XO		select-other-window
   
   When  in  two-window  mode,  (see ^X2) move the cursor to the other window,
   implicitly  (usually)  switching buffers.  The mode line will be updated to
   reflect the new buffer.  The cursor will appear at the last point it was in
   the  new  window.   In general, the cursor will enter the window used last,
   immediately before the current window was entered.
   
^XQ		macro-query
   
   Query.   Only  usable  while  macros are being collected: when the macro is
   run, ^XQ will query the user for a character: space will continue execution
   of  the  macro.   ^G  will  stop  the macro altogether.  CR or other random
   characters will restart the macro from the beginning.  In this way,

  ^X( ^S f o o ESC ^XQ esc-U ^X)

will "query replace", i.e., interrogatively upper-case all foo's.
   
^XR		rmail
   
   Enters  the  Emacs RMAIL subsystem to read mail.  Without an argument, that
   is,  ^XR, your default mailbox is used.  With an argument, that is, ^U ^XR,
   the   mailbox   name,   which   may  take  any  reasonable  form  (such  as
   Washington.States, Palter, >udd>m>abc>abc, etc) is prompted for.  The first
   message  in  the  mailbox is placed in a buffer in RMAIL mode.  Type "q" to
   exit  RMAIL and delete all mail queued for deletion during RMAIL.  Refer to
   rmail.info for full info on RMAIL and reading and sending mail.
   
^XS		global-print
   
   Global  print  all  lines a la QEDX.  Prompts for a string.  With a numeric
   argument,  i.e.,  ^U^XS,  takes  a QEDX-like regular string.  End in either
   case  with  CR.   Prints  all  lines  containing  that  string.  Type ^J or
   continue editing to restore buffer display.
   
^XV		view-lines
   
   View  lines  or  region,  for  printing  terminals.   The  optional numeric
   argument is how many lines to print- leaves you after them, unless argument
   is  1  or  not supplied, in which case it leaves you on current line, after
   printing it.  ESC-0^XV views the region (between cursor and the-mark), thus
   ^XH  ESC-0^XV  prints  the  whole buffer.  With a negative argument, prints
   lines starting that many back.
   
^XW		multi-word-search
   
   Multi-word search.  Prompts for one or more words, terminated by CR.  (this
   is  a search string; just CR re-uses last).  Searches from current point to
   end  for  those  words  appearing  in order, regardless of case of letters,
   underlining,  intervening  punctuation,  whitespace, or line breaks.  Finds
   whole words, not parts of words.  A word that ends in * will match the rest
   of  a  word  to  *.  With a numeric argument, (^U^XW), goes to beginning of
   buffer before searching.
   
^XX		put-variable
   
   Store  away  point/mark region to a "variable", whose name will be prompted
   for.  Use ^XG to retreive this value, and list-variables to get it back.
   
^X\177		kill-backward-sentence
   
   Kill  backwards  to  the  beginning  of  this sentence: kill as much of the
   sentence  as  thus  far  typed.   Successive  kills  via  ^X\177  and other
   reverse-killing commands (e.g., esc-#) merge, and may be retrieved with one
   ^Y.
   
^X^B		list-buffers
   
   Produces listing of buffers and their pathnames.  ">" marks buffer you came
   from,  "*"  says  buffer  is  modified  since  it was last read or written.
   Proceed with editing, or type ^J to refresh screen.
   
^X^C		quit-the-editor
   
   Exit the editor.  If modified buffers exist, they are listed as if by ^X^B;
   ^X^C then asks you if you really want to exit the editor.
   
^X^E		comout-command
   
   Executes  a Multics command line (prompted for, end with CR), and places the
   output  in  a  buffer; if the command line is empty this request is aborted.
   The output is placed in the buffer "file_output"; however, if the command is
   given  a  numeric  argument  (e.g.   ^U^X^E)  the "comout-command-to-buffer"
   command (see below) is executed.  The file_output buffer is made the current
   buffer.
 
^U^X^E		comout-command-to-buffer

   This is like "comout-command", except the user is prompted for the name of a
   buffer  (which  is  used  instead  of  "file_output").  This can be made the
   normal operation of ^X^E by placing the following line in the start_up.emacs
   (see   Appendix   G   for   more   information   on   the   start_up.emacs):
   (set-permanent-key "^X^E" comout-command-to-buffer)
 
^X^F		find-file
   
   Find  file.   Prompts  for  a  filename,  terminated by CR.  If the file is
   already in a buffer, ^X^F goes to that buffer (see ^XB).  If the file is in
   more than one buffer, you will be queried about which one (or a new one) to
   use.   If  the  file  is  not  in  any buffers, it will be read into a new,
   appropriately-named  buffer.  This is the standard way to read in a file or
   create a buffer for a new file.

   If no such buffer exists, ^X^F reads the file into the buffer whose name is
   the  first  component  of  the  entry portion of the filename, and sets the
   default   file   of   this   buffer   to   the  file  just  read.   If  the
   find-file-set-modes  option  is  on,  ^X^F  will  set the major mode of the
   buffer  according  to  the  last  component  of  the  entry  portion of the
   filename.   (For example, for the filename ">ldd>include>sst.incl.pl1", the
   buffer chosen is "sst" and the major mode is "PL/1".)

   ^X^F  will  accept  archive component pathnames (archive::component).  ^X^F
   also  accepts  star  names  (including  stars  in the archive and component
   names).   When  more  than one star match is found, a ^X^F is done for each
   segment/archive component selected.
   
^X^G		ignore-prefix
   
   Flush  a  prefix  character.   Used  when a prefix character such as ESC is
   entered by accident; causes an audible signal to indicate that the ^X^G has
   been executed.  Unlike ^G, does not exit the minibuffer.
   
^X^I		indent-rigidly
   
   Re-indents  all  lines  in the region defined by the cursor and the mark by
   the  amount specified by the numeric argument.  The numeric argument may be
   negative  to  unindent.   All  lines  that  have any characters between the
   cursor  and  the  mark  will  be  re-indented; thus, a line with the region
   ending at its beginning will not be re-indented.
   
^X^L		lower-case-region
   
   Lower-case all letters between the cursor and the mark.
   
^X^O		delete-blank-lines
   
   Delete  blank  lines  around  cursor:  get  rid of vertical whitespace.  If
   issued  on a blank line, leave one blank line.  Otherwise, delete all blank
   lines after this line's end.  See ^O.
   
^X^R		read-file
   
   Read file.  Prompts for a filename, terminated by CR.  Reads that file into
   the  current  buffer  destroying anything which was in the buffer, and sets
   this  buffer's  default  file  to the file read.  The cursor is left at the
   first  position of the first line of the file read.  If a blank response is
   given  for  the  filename,  the buffer's default file is read.  The default
   file is set by ^X^R, ^X^F, and ^X^W.

   Archive  component pathnames are accepted.  Starnames are accepted too, but
   no more than one segment or archive component must match.
   
^X^S		save-same-file
   
   Save  file.  Writes the contents of the current buffer to its default file.
   This command is equivalent to ^X^WCR.
   
^X^T		toggle-redisplay
   
   Turns  off  all screen updating until the next ^X^T, command-quit, or error
   happens.   ^X^T  may  be  used  on  slow  terminals  with  no insert/delete
   facilities  to  avoid excessive printing time for operations such as typing
   in the middle of a line.
   
^X^U		upper-case-region
   
   Upper-case all characters between the cursor and the mark.
   
^X^W		write-file
   
   Writes  the  current  buffer out to a file, whose relative pathname will be
   prompted  for in the minibuffer.  Terminate response with a CR.  If a blank
   or null response is given, write it out to this buffer's default file.  The
   file specified becomes the buffer's default file.  See ^X^S.
   
^X^X		exchange-point-and-mark
   
   Exchange  the  cursor  and  the-mark,  to  verify what you are getting into
   before  typing  ^W  or similar.  Puts the cursor where the-mark is and vice
   versa.   ^X^X  ^X^X  quickly verifies the extent of the "point-mark region"
   visually  and  puts  things  back.   Use  ^U  ^@ to visit older settings of
   the-mark in this buffer.
   
^X_		underline-region

   Underlines the region between the point and the mark.  If the option
   underline-whitespace is On, underline the spaces also (Default is Off).
   With a numeric argument, removes the underlining from the region.

^Y		yank
   
   Yank  (retrieve) killed text to cursor.  Unkills last killed word, line, or
   region  (^W).   With  a  numeric argument, goes that many killings down the
   10-position kill ring.  Leaves the-mark at the front of the retrieved text,
   and the point at the end.
   
^Z;		kill-comment
   
   Removes  the comment and the whitespace preceding it from the current line.
   The  deleted text is saved on the kill ring, accessible to ^Y.  The text is
   saved  in  such a way that folowing ^K's and other forward-killing commands
   will merge properly with the deleted text.
   
^ZG		go-to-named-mark
   
   Prompt  for  the  name  of a "named mark", and move the cursor to the point
   where that mark was saved.  Use ^Z^@ to set a named mark.
   
^Z^@		set-named-mark
   
   Prompt  for the name of a "named mark", and set that named mark to be where
   the  cursor is now.  Named marks are valid only in the buffer in which they
   were created.  Use ^ZG to go to a named mark.
   
^Z^B		edit-buffers
   
   Enters  the  buffer  editor.   If given no argument, i.e., ^Z^B, the buffer
   editor  will  set  up  its  display  in  the  current  window.  If given an
   argument, i.e., ^U ^Z^B, the buffer editor will find some other appropriate
   window   (if  in  two-or-more-window  mode)  to  set  itself  up  in.   See
   windows.info for full information on the buffer editor.
   
^Z^F		get-filename
   
   Inserts the pathname (as seen in the mode-line below) of the current buffer
   at  the  cursor.   With  an  argument, inserts the entryname portion of the
   pathname  only.   If  the  pathname  is  an archive component pathname, the
   componentname is inserted.
   
^Z^G		ignore-prefix
   
   Flush  a  prefix  character.   Used  when a prefix character such as ESC is
   entered by accident; causes an audible signal to indicate that the ^Z^G has
   been executed.  Unlike ^G, does not exit the minibuffer.
   
^Z^V		scroll-current-window
   
   Scrolls the current window (or whole screen, in one-window mode) up or down
   a  specified  number  of lines.  The cursor remains on the same line of the
   buffer.   The  numeric  argument  tells how many lines to scroll it up; the
   default is one line up.  A negative numeric argument indicates scrolling it
   down.  Thus, ESC - 3 ^Z^V scrolls the current window three lines down.
   
^Z^W		edit-windows
   
   Enter  the window editor to create, realign, destroy, or visit windows.  If
   given no argument, i.e., ^Z^W, the window editor will set up its display in
   the window where the cursor currently sits.  If given an argument, i.e., ^U
   ^Z^W,  the  window editor will find some appropriate window in which to set
   up shop.  See windows.info for full information on the window editor.
   
^Z^Z		signalquit
   
   Signals  QUIT  to  Multics.  Restores normal tty modes before so doing, and
   sets them back as Emacs needs them after having typed start.
   
^Z_		remove-underlining-from-word
   
   Remove  underlining  from  the  current  or  previous  word:  the rules for
   selecting which word are the same as those used by uppercase-word.
   
^_		help-on-tap
   
   Gets  help/documentation  at  any time.  This feature is now only partially
   complete.  The current repertoire is:

  ^_ H  Find out where to get more help.
  ^_ ?  Display the current repertoire of ^_
  ^_ A  Prompt for a string to search for appropriate
         commands (same as esc-X apropos).
  ^_ C  Prompt for a key sequence to document (same as
         esc-?).
  ^_ D  Prompt for the name of an extended command to
         document (same as esc-X describe).
  ^_ L  Display the last 50 characters typed in.
  ^_ ^G Do a command-quit as usual.
   
esc-#		rubout-word
   
   Delete  the  word  to  the  left  of the current point.  More specifically,
   delete  going backwards, deleting characters until the beginning of a word.
   Successive  words  deleted  with esc-# are merged and may be retrieved with
   one ^Y.
   
esc-%		query-replace
   
   Interactively  replaces  all  occurences  of  one string with another.  The
   command  prompts  for  both  strings  in  the minibuffer, and then searches
   forward  for  each  occurrence  of the first string.  Terminate the strings
   with  CR.   It positions the cursor immediately after this string and waits
   for one of the following responses:

  space  -- replaces this particular occurrence of the first string
	  with the second.  Then searches for the next occurrence of
	  the first string and waits for a response again.
  ,      -- same as space, but redisplays before searching on.
            Normally, esc-% redisplays only before prompting.
  return -- leaves this occurrence of the first string alone and searches
	  for the next occurrence of the first string.
  period -- replaces this occurrence of the first string with the second
	  and terminates the query replace.
  !      -- Replaces this and all succeeding occurences of the
            first string by the second, without asking.
  ^G     -- terminates the query replace without modifying this
	  occurrence of the first string.
  ESC    -- same as ^G.
   
esc-/		regexp-search-command
   
   Search  forward  regular  expression,  `a  la "QEDX".  Terminate the regular
   expression  by  CR,  we  supply  the  slashes.   All rules for QEDX regular
   expressions  apply.   Searches  forward  from  cursor,  and  can  find many
   occurences  of  the  regular  expresion on one line.  Leaves the cursor and
   the-mark around the string it finds, so that

   s/(fo.*)/(a b & )/ (QEDX)
 = esc-/(fo.*) CR ^W( a b ^Y )  (EMACS)

   
esc-;		indent-for-comment
   
   Searches for this line's comment.  If one exists, indents it to the comment
   column  in  this buffer (see ^X;).  If one does not exist, start one at the
   comment  column  on  this line.  Uses the "comment-prefix" to search for an
   old one or start a new one.  See also set-comment-prefix.

   
esc-<		go-to-beginning-of-buffer
   
   Move  to  the  beginning  of  the  current  buffer,  i.e., before the first
   character in the buffer, that is, the top of the document being edited.
   
esc->		go-to-end-of-buffer
   
   Move to the end of the current buffer, i.e., before the newline on the last
   line  of  the  current  buffer.   In  other  words, go to the bottom of the
   document being edited.  There is no way to position beyond that newline.
   
esc-?		describe-key
   
   Display  the  documentation  for  a given key sequence.  To find out what a
   Control  D  does,  type  esc-?   and a Control D.  With a numeric argument,
   i.e.,  ^U  esc-?,  just  the  command  name  to  which the key is currently
   connected will be displayed in the minibuffer.
   
esc-A		backward-sentence
   
   Go  to  the  beginning of the current sentence, i.e., just before the first
   letter.   If already at the beginning of a sentence, go to the beginning of
   the  previous sentence.  The beginning of the first word after a blank line
   always counts as the beginning of a sentence.
   
esc-B		backward-word
   
   Go  backward  one  word.   If  in  the  middle  of a word, go to before the
   beginning  of that word.  Skips backwards over all whitespace to get to the
   next word.  Underscores and backspaces count as parts of words.
   
esc-C		capitalize-initial-word
   
   Capitalize a word, leading capital, rest of word lower-case, like "Word".
   If the cursor is in a word or immediately after a word,capitalize that word.
   Otherwise, do the next word.  With a numeric argument, do that many words;
   with a negative numeric argument, to that many backward.  Leaves cursor
   immediately after the last word (or before the first word) capitalized.
   
esc-CR		cret-and-indent-relative
   
   Does  a  CR and a indent-relative.  Basically, this means finish this line,
   and  start  a  new  line,  indented  the same as the previous line.  If the
   original line was not indented, note that this will line up with the second
   word  on  the first line.  This is the command you want to terminate a line
   of an indented body of text.
   
esc-D		delete-word
   
   Delete  the  word  to  the  right of the current point.  More specifically,
   delete   going   forward,  deleting  all  whitespace  and  punctuation  and
   characters until the end of the next word.
   
esc-E		forward-sentence
   
   Move  forward  to  the  end of this sentence.  If at the end of a sentence,
   move  forward  to  the  end  of  the next sentence.  Ends of paragraphs are
   implicitly ends of sentences, whether or not an end-of-sentence punctuation
   (period, question mark, exclamation point) appears.
   
esc-ESC		eval-lisp-line
   
   Prompt  for  a string for Lisp to evaluate; put a pair of parens around it,
   evaluate  it  in  Lisp (with ibase = 8) and print out the Lisp value in the
   minibuffer  (base = 8, *nopoint nil).  To get a variable value, use esc-ESC
   progn <varname> CR.
   
esc-F		forward-word
   
   Go  forward  one  word.  If in the middle of a word, move to the end of the
   current  word.   Leaves point immediately after that word.  All punctuation
   and  whitespace before the word are moved over.  Underscores and backspaces
   count as parts of words.
   
esc-G		go-to-line-number
   
   Goes  to  a  given  line, given by line number, from the top of the buffer.
   The numeric argument specifies the line number.  For instance, ESC 25 esc-G
   goes to line 25.  If the line number  is not specified,  prompts for a line
   to go to.

esc-H		mark-paragraph
   
   Put  the-mark at the beginning of the current paragraph.  Put the cursor at
   the  end  of  the  current  paragraph.   See  esc-[  for  a  definition  of
   paragraphs.
   
esc-I		tab-to-previous-columns
   
   Indent the current point on this line (where the cursor is) to line up with
   the  next  non-whitespace  item on the previous non-blank line.  Successive
   invocations   of   esc-I   cause   attempts  to  line  up  with  succeeding
   non-whitespace  items.   This is ideal for building columnated tables, etc.
   Type  in  the  first  line by hand, and use esc-I to get to each new field,
   column,  etc.   on succeeding lines.  Typed on an empty line, or at the end
   of  a  line,  it positions for the next text to be entered.  With a numeric
   argument,  esc-I  uses previously undented lines (other than the last line)
   for a model, thus facilitating typing in outlines, etc.
   
esc-K		kill-to-end-of-sentence
   
   Delete  text  going  forward  from  the  cursor  to  the end of the current
   sentence.   If  at  the end of a sentence, delete forward to the end of the
   next  sentence.   Sentences  and  other  text  killed consecutively in this
   fashion are merged, and may be retrieved with a single ^Y.
   
esc-L		lower-case-word
   
   Convert a word to all lower-case, like "word".  If the cursor is in a word
   or immediately after a word, lower-case that word.  Otherwise, do the next
   word.  Convert a word to all upper-case, like "WORD".  If the cursor is in
   a word or immediately after a word, upper-case that word.  Otherwise, do
   the next word.  With a numeric argument, do that many words; with a negative
   numeric argument, to that many backward.  Leaves cursor immediately after
   the last word (or before the first word) lower-cased.
   
esc-M		skip-over-indentation
   
   Move  the  cursor  to  the  first  non-whitespace  (i.e.,  not  tab, blank,
   formfeed,  or  vertical  tab)  position on this line.  In other words, skip
   over the indentation on this line.
   
esc-N		down-comment-line
   
   Properly  indents  the  comment  on the next line, or puts a comment on the
   next  line,  if  there  is  not one there already.  Effectively the same as
   ^Nesc-;.  See esc-;.
   
esc-P		prev-comment-line
   
   Indent  the  comment on the previous line properly.  If there is no comment
   on  the  previous  line, put one there, indented properly.  Effectively the
   same as ^Pesc-;.  See esc-;.
   
esc-Q		runoff-fill-paragraph
   
   "Fill"  the  current  paragraph,  like  runoff/compose  with  ".na".   With
   argument  (i.e., ESC-1 esc-Q), fill and adjust like runoff/compose with .fi
   and  .ad.   Right  margin is determined by fill column, left margin by fill
   prefix.   Runoff/compose  control lines count as their own paragraphs.  See
   ^XF to set fill-column, and ^X.  to set fill prefix.
   
esc-R		move-to-screen-edge
   
   Move to top, bottom, or other point on screen.  ESC-1 esc-R is the top line
   of  the  screen, ESC 6 esc-R is the 6th line from the top, ESC - 4 esc-R is
   the  fourth  line from the bottom.  A very large number is also the bottom.
   Leaves the cursor on the start of the selected line.
   
esc-S		center-line
   
   Center the current line, according to fill-column (see ^XF).


esc-T		twiddle-words
   
   Twiddle  (transpose,  interchange)  the  last two words typed, like: like I
   esc-T  Multics  because...   If  you are currently in the middle of a word,
   goes to the end of the word first.

   
esc-U		upper-case-word
   
   Convert a word to all upper-case, like "WORD".  If the cursor is in a word
   or immediately after a word, upper-case that word.  Otherwise, do the next
   word.  With a numeric argument, do that many words; with a negative numeric
   argument, to that many backward.  Leaves cursor immediately after the last
   word (or before the first word) uppercased.
   
esc-V		prev-screen
   
   Display  the  previous  screen (one back) of this buffer, leaving cursor at
   the top of it.  With an argument, displays that many screens backward.
   
esc-W		copy-region
   
   Copies  the  text between the cursor and the-mark on to the top of the kill
   ring.   This  means  that  the  next  ^Y will copy the text now between the
   cursor and the-mark to wherever the cursor is when the ^Y is issued.
   
esc-X		extended-command
   
   Prompt  for  the  name  and  arguments  of  an  extended  commands  in  the
   minibuffer.   Terminate  with  CR.   To find out about an extended command,
   type

	esc-X describe <name-of-command> CR
   
esc-Y		wipe-this-and-yank-previous
   
   I  don't like what I just ^Y'ed.  Get rid of it and yank the previous thing
   in  its place.  Used to retrieve the previous "kill" when you find that the
   thing  that you just ^Y'ed was the wrong thing.  In more detail, delete the
   text  between  the  cursor  and the-mark without saving it, rotate the kill
   ring one position, and ^Y.
   
esc-[		beginning-of-paragraph
   
   Move  to  the  beginning  of  the  current  paragraph.   If  already at the
   beginning  of a paragraph, move to the beginning of the previous paragraph.
   The  beginning  of  a  paragraph  is the beginning of the first line of the
   paragraph.    The   definition   of   paragraphs   is   controlled  by  the
   paragraph-definition-type  option;  if  1, blank lines separate paragraphs.
   If  2,  an  indented  line  starts a paragraph.  Runoff and compose control
   lines count as paragraphs.
   
esc-\		delete-white-sides
   
   Delete  all  whitespace  characters  on  the  current  line surrounding the
   cursor.   In  this  context,  a  whitespace  character is a space, a tab, a
   formfeed, or a vertical tab.
   
esc-\177		rubout-word
   
   Delete  the  word  to  the  left  of the current point.  More specifically,
   delete  going backwards, deleting characters until the beginning of a word.
   Successive words deleted with esc-\177 are merged and may be retrieved with
   one ^Y.
   
esc-]		end-of-paragraph
   
   Move  to  the  end of the current paragraph.  If at the end of a paragraph,
   move  to  the end of the next paragraph.  The end of a paragraph is the end
   of  the  last  line  of  the  paragraph.   The  definition of paragraphs is
   controlled  by  the  paragraph-definition-type  option;  if  1, blank lines
   separate  paragraphs.   If  2, an indented line starts a paragraph.  Runoff
   and compose control lines count as paragraphs.
   
esc-^		delete-line-indentation
   
   Without  a  numeric  argument,  i.e.,  esc-^,  delete all whitespace at the
   beginning  of  this line and then merge it with the previous line.  With an
   argument,  i.e.,  ^Uesc-^,  does  a  ^N  first,  so  that ^Uesc-^ in effect
   "connects"   the   next  line  into  this  one,  without  the  next  line's
   indentation.
   
esc-^B		balance-parens-backward
   
   Skip  backward over one set of balanced parentheses.  Will search backwards
   until  a  set  of  parentheses  is  found.   Does not handle quoting or any
   programming language conventions.
   
esc-^C		compile-buffer

   Compiles  the buffer.  Writes the current buffer out to its default pathname
   (as for ^X^S), and then compiles it.  Compiler diagnostics are placed in the
   buffer "Compilation Errors" if the option "one-error-scan-buffer" is On (the
   default); if it is Off then the diagnostics are placed in the buffer "<name>
   Errors",  where  <name>  is  replaced  with  the  name  of  the buffer being
   compiled.   (This  allows several buffers to be compiled without overwriting
   each  other's  error  messages.)  If in two-window mode, the error buffer is
   displayed  in another window; if the option "compile-two-windows" is On (the
   default  is  Off) then this command will automatically enter two-window mode
   if  necessary.  If the "compile-local-display" option is On (default is Off)
   and  "compile-two-windows" is Off, the error messages will be displayed as a
   local  display  (in  addition  to being put in a buffer).  If neither is set
   (the   default),   a  one-line  local  display  will  indicate  whether  the
   compilation  was successful.  The extended requests "ESC X set-compiler" and
   "ESC  X  set-compile-options" can be used to select the compiler and options
   to be used.
   
esc-^F		balance-parens-forward

   Skip  forward  over  one  set of balanced parentheses.  Will search forward
   until a set of parentheses is found.  Does not handle quoting, or any other
   programming language conventions.
   
esc-^G		ignore-prefix
   
   Flush  a  prefix  character.   Used  when a prefix character such as ESC is
   entered  by  accident; causes an audible signal to indicate that the esc-^G
   has been executed.  Unlike ^G, does not exit the minibuffer.
   
esc-^I		indent-to-fill-prefix
   
   Delete  the  indentation  (leading  whitespace)  of  the  current line, and
   replace it with the fill prefix in this buffer.  See ^X..
   
esc-^O		split-line
   
   Break  the  line  at this point, shear it vertically.  Puts the text to the
   right of the cursor on the next line, with enough indentation so that it is
   still  in the same place horizontally.  This can be undone by ^Uesc-^.  See
   esc-^.
   
esc-^V		page-other-window
   
   Valid only when more than one window exists.  With no argument, causes a ^V
   to  be  done  on the other window (i.e., the one the cursor is not now in);
   with  an  argument,  pages  the  other window that many screens backward or
   forward;  thus,  ESC  -  esc-^V  pages the other window one backward.  Very
   useful  for  "paging"  compiler  diagnostics while editing a program.  When
   more  than  two windows are in use, the "next most recently visited" window
   will be considered to be the "other window".
   
esc-^W		merge-last-kills-with-next
   
   Causes  the  next kill-type commands (example, ^K, esc-D) which must follow
   immediately,  to  merge what they kill with the last saved kill on the kill
   ring, in the same direction as the next command kills.  For instance, ^A ^K
   ^K ^N ^N esc-^W ^K ^K catenates two disjoint lines on the kill ring.
   
esc-^Y		yank-minibuf
   
   Yank  back  the last content of the minibuffer, without prompt string.  The
   mark  will be set in the minibuffer, so ^X^X may be used to position around
   it,  and  ^W  to  delete  it.  The real mark in the main buffer will not be
   destroyed.
   
esc-_		underline-word
   
   Canonically underscore the current or previous word.  Although it will look
   peculiar  on  the screen, it will be correct, and runoff-paragraph and fill
   and  dprint  correctly.   The  rules for selecting which word to do are the
   same as those used by uppercase-word.
   
esc-~		unmodify-buffer
   
   Marks  the  current  buffer  as  not modified.  Emacs will not mention this
   buffer  when  querying because of a ^X^C.  esc-~ is useful after accidently
   modifying a buffer which you only intended to examine.
   




			E__x_t_e_n_d_e_d C__o_m_m_a_n_d_s

Type esc-X followed by the command name, and a carriage return to invoke these
commands.

esc-X accept-messages
   
   Accept  Multics interactive console messages into Emacs buffers, one buffer
   per correspondent.  Causes messages to be displayed as local output as they
   arrive.  All correspondence to and from each correspondent is maintained in
   a  buffer  named  "Messages from <PersonName>", in which carriage return is
   bound  to respond-from-buffer, which causes messages to be transmitted when
   a  line  is typed by you into that buffer.  In these buffers, conversations
   "transcript"  as  with  send_message  in  "input  mode".  The following key
   bindings are set up globally by accept-msgs: (see their documentation):

	^X:  message-response-command (responds to last sender from
		minibuffer).
	^X'  go-to-new-message-buffer (goes to a message buffer).
               With an argument, lists message buffers (conversations)
          ^X`  send-a-message (prompts for user name and then message)
          ^X~  repeat-last-message (reprints last interactive message)
   
esc-X accept-messages-path
   
   Accepts messages on some other mailbox than the user's default mailbox.  Up
   to  50  mailboxes  may  be  accepting  messages  at once in a process.  The
   argument  to  esc-X  accept-messages-path  is  either  a  mailbox  pathname
   (containing  >'s  or  <'s) or a user-name (for sites using the ARPANet Mail
   Daemon)  or  a  pair  of  the form User.Project.  The effect is the same as
   esc-X accept-messages.
   
esc-X alm-mode
   
   Enter  ALM  major  mode in this buffer.  ALM mode consists of many commands
   and  variable  settings  suitable  for  the  creation  and  editing  of ALM
   programs.
   
esc-X apropos
   
   Lists  all  commands and extended commands that "mention" a given string in
   their names, and tell what, if any, keys invoke them in the current buffer.
   For instance,

    apropos forw

   will  list forward-word, forward-char, etc.  This is the most common way to
   "find" a command that does something you are looking for.
   
esc-X compose-mode

   Mode for editing compose text files.  Turns on fill mode automatically.
   Equivalent to the text-mode and runoff-mode commands; entered automatically
   for files with a last component of ".runoff" or ".compin" if the option
   find-file-set-modes is On (Default is Off).

esc-X describe
   
   Display the documentation for an extended command.  The command name is the
   argument describe.  For example,

	esc-X describe apropos CR

to find out about the "apropos" extended command.
   
esc-X edit-macros
   
   Produces  a  symbolic  file  of  all keyboard macros defined in the current
   buffer  and  places  it  in  a new buffer.  The keyboard macros may then be
   written  out  for  later  loading, edited, redefined, or compiled into Lisp
   code.  See macro-edit.info for full information.
   
esc-X electric-alm-mode

   Enters ALM mode, with several commands for automatically formatting ALM.

esc-X electric-pl1-mode
   
   Enters  Electric  PL/I mode in the current buffer.  Electric PL/I mode is a
   variant  of PL/I mode in which semicolons and colons have violent automatic
   "electric"  action  which  may be disturbing to some, but useful to others.
   See pl1-mode.info.
   
esc-X filloff
   
   Turns off fill mode in this buffer, if it is on.
   
esc-X fillon
   
   Turn  on  Fill Mode (a minor mode) in this buffer.  In Fill Mode, text will
   be  wrapped  around lines so as not to extend past the fill column (see ^XF
   to  set  that).   When  a space, tab, or punctuation mark is placed after a
   word  which  passes  the  fill column, the line will be broken at the first
   whitespace  from  the  end of the line.  filloff turns it off.  To insert a
   character  to  cause  a  line  deliberately to extend pass the fill column,
   either type CR or precede the character with ^Q.
   
esc-X fortran-mode
   
   Enter  Fortran  major  mode  in this buffer.  Fortran mode consists of many
   commands  and  variable  settings  suitable for the creation and editing of
   Fortran  programs.   See fortran-mode.info for a list of the commands and a
   description  of this mode.  You can issue the command esc-X apropos fortran
   CR in a Fortran mode buffer for a list of relevant commands in this mode.
   
esc-X fundamental-mode
   
   Enters  the  mode  (set  of  key  bindings  and variable settings) that all
   buffers start out in.  This can be used to "undo" any other major mode that
   you may have set.
   
esc-X ldebug
   
   Enters a "Lisp Top Level" buffer in Lisp Debug mode.  Forms typed into this
   buffer  are  evaluated  and  the  value  is displayed by placing it in this
   buffer.   When  esc-X  ldebug  has been used, all Lisp errors in Emacs trap
   into  this  buffer.   ESC-P  restarts  a  break.   See ldebug.info for more
   information.
   
esc-X lisp-mode
   
   Enter  Lisp major mode in this buffer.  Lisp mode consists of many commands
   and  variable  settings  suitable  for  the  creation  and  editing of Lisp
   programs.   See lisp-mode.info for a list of the commands and a description
   of this mode.
   
esc-X list-named-marks
   
   Display  a  list of all of the named marks in the current buffer.  Use ^Z^@
   to create a named mark, and ^ZG to go to one.
   
esc-X loadfile
   
   Loads  a  private Emacs extension package into the editor.  The argument is
   its pathname.
   
esc-X loadlib
   
   Load  an  "uninstalled"  extension  package  into  Emacs.   Normally,  such
   packages  are "autoloaded" when commands in them are invoked, but from time
   to  time,  new,  experimental,  or  highly specialized packages may require
   being  loaded  in this way.  The single argument is the name of the package
   to be loaded.  Loading a package makes the commands in it available.
   
esc-X lvars
   
   Display  the names and lengths of all "variables" saved by ^XX.  Type ^J to
   resume, or just continue editing.  See ^XX and ^XG.
   
esc-X make-wall-chart
   
   Puts  into  a  buffer  a "Wall Chart", describing all the currently defined
   commands  and  what  keys invoke them in the current buffer.  The resultant
   buffer is intended for dprinting.
   
esc-X opt
   
   Also "option".  Sets non-obvious internal flags and defaults, each of which
   have names.  Takes three forms,

	opt list			List all options and settings.
	opt NAME VALUE		Set option value.
	opt status NAME		Report setting of one option.

   Values  may be on, off, or numbers, depending on the option.  Code, such as
   startups, can simply set these Lisp variables.  (on/off => t/nil).  Current
   options are:

    display-ctlchar-with-^  Causes control characters to print as
		        ^P instead of \020.
    suppress-ctlchar-display  Don't show control characters.  Any character
		        which would print as \NNN (except \177) is not
		        displayed.
    suppress-rubout-display Don't show rubout characters.  Causes \177 to
		        never be displayed.  Usefull when reading ALM
		        listing segments.
    suppress-backspace-display Don't show backspaces.  Causes underlined
		          "foo" to print as "_f_o_o".
    rdis-whitespace-optimize Avoid printing whitespace when clever
		         terminal control would go faster.  Currently
		         on by default, but adds a little expense.
    rdis-wosclr-opt	     Wipe Out Screen lines before filling screen.
		       Try it both ways to see what this means.
    paragraph-definition-type 1 (default) = blank lines precede
		       paragraphs. 2 = indented line starts one.
    find-file-set-modes  When on, find-filing foo.pl1 sets pl1 mode, etc.
    track-eol-opt	     When on, ^N, ^P at eol stick to ends of lines.
    default-fill-column	 Fill column for new buffers.
    default-comment-column Comment column for new buffers (0 origin).
    pop-up-windows	     When on, ^XB, ^X^F, ^X^E, etc., find an
			appropriate place on the screen to put up
			a window as opposed to replacing contents
			of current window (highly experimental).
   
esc-X pl1-mode
   
   Enter  PL/I major mode in this buffer.  PL/I mode consists of many commands
   and  variable  settings  suitable  for  the  creation  and  editing of PL/I
   programs.   See  pl1-mode.info for a list of the commands and a description
   of  this  mode.   You  can issue the command esc-X apropos pl1 CR in a PL/I
   mode buffer for a list of relevant commands in this mode.
   
esc-X replace
   
   Global  replace  of  one string with another, from the current point to the
   end  of  the  buffer.  Prompts for two strings, which must be terminated by
   CR.   If  the  first string is not found, esc-X replace will not prompt for
   the second string, and will not move the cursor.
   
esc-X reset-minibuffer-size
   
   Resets  the  size  of  the  minibuffer/prompting area to its default of two
   lines.  See set-minibuffer-size.
   
esc-X reset-screen-size
   
   reset-screen-size

   Resets  the  size  of  the  main editing area of the screen to its default,
   namely, all of the space above the mode line.  See set-screen-size.
   
esc-X runoff-fill-region
   
   Fills/adjusts  an  entire  region  in  the  same  way  as  esc-Q  does to a
   paragraph.   It  does  not  respect  paragraph  breaks:  this makes it only
   marginally useful.
   
esc-X runoff-mode

   Mode for editing runoff text files.  Turns on fill mode automatically.
   Equivalent to the text-mode and compose-mode commands; entered automatically
   for files with a last component of ".runoff" or ".compin" if the option
   find-file-set-modes is On (Default is Off).

esc-X save-macro
   
   Saves  a  macro,  assigning  it to a key.  Invoke it after a macro has been
   defined.  Will prompt for a command name to assign to the macro, and a key.
   When a key has been assigned, this key will invoke that macro- it will take
   arguments identical to ^XE.
   
esc-X set-comment-prefix
   
   Set the "comment prefix" in this buffer.  This is usually set automatically
   by  entering  a  major mode.  The comment prefix is given as an argument to
   this  command,  in quotes.  The comment prefix is used by esc-;, esc-N, and
   esc-P to find comments, and start them.
   
esc-X set-compile-options
   
   In  language  modes  that  support ESC-^C for "compile buffer", and similar
   (e.g.,  PL/I, FORTRAN), sets non-default compilation options to be given to
   the appropriate compiler.
   
esc-X set-compiler
   
   Sets  the  name  of  the  compiler to be used by the compile-buffer command
   (usually  ESC-^C)  in  those  language  modes that compile buffers this way
   (e.g.,  PL/I,  FORTRAN).   The single argument to esc-X set-compiler is the
   compiler name.
   
esc-X set-key
   
   Assigns  key bindings in the current buffer.  Takes two arguments, the "Key
   name"  and  the  command name.  Makes that key execute that command in this
   buffer.    The   command  name  is  what  describe-command  or  apropos  or
   make-wall-chart  give;  the key name can be anything like the names in this
   documentation,  e.g., ^X, ^x, ESC-ESC, ^Xq, control-p, c-p, meta-f, esc-^f,
   CR, ^X-^F, ^X-CR, \177, #, A, ^P, etc.  For instance, you might want to say
   
	set-key ^Z quit-the-editor

if you want the privilege of quitting in one keystroke.
   
esc-X set-minibuffer-size
   
   Sets  the size of the minibuffer/prompting area on the screen to any value.
   The  single  argument to esc-X set-minibuffer-size is the decimal number of
   how  many  lines  should  be devoted to this function.  The default is two.
   With  many-line  minibuffers,  many messages and errors may appear at once.
   Use  reset-minibuffer-size  to  reset the minibuffer size to its default of
   two lines.  Valid sizes are 1 to 6.
   
esc-X set-permanent-key
   
   Used  to  set  permanent (default in all buffers) key bindings.  Otherwise,
   works exactly like set-key.  See set-key.
   
esc-X set-screen-size
   
   Set  the  size  of  the main editing area (the area above the Mode Line) to
   other  than  its  default.   The  default is all of the area above the mode
   line.  The decimal argument to esc-X set-screen-size is the number of lines
   in  the main editing area.  reset-screen-size may be used to reset the main
   editing  area  size to its default value.  esc-X set-screen-size is usually
   used to reduce the amount of redisplay at low terminal speeds.
   
esc-X set-search-mode
   
   Sets  the  bindings  of  ^S  and  ^R  to  invoke several different forms of
   searching.  The argument is the search mode.

   The known search modes are:

     string 		Searches for the exact character
			string typed (the default).
     regular-expression	The string typed is interpreted as a
	  or  regexp	QEDX regular expression.
     character		Searches for the single character
			typed.  Control characters control
			sophisticated options.
     ITS-string		A type of search popularized by
			Dave Moon and Dan Weinreb on MIT-AI,
			having many sophisticated features.
     incremental		Searches for a string showing the
			state of the search as each character
			is entered.

   All  searches  prompt telling the type of search that has been invoked.  To
   find  out more about these different kinds of searches, set the search mode
   of interest, and do an esc-?  ^S.
   
esc-X setab
   
   Define  one  word  as  an  abbreviation for another for Speedtype mode, for
   instance,

     setab edr editor

   Will  accept  multiple pairs of arguments.  If the second string (the thing
   being  abbreviated)  is many words, or has special characters in it, put it
   in quotes.
   
esc-X show-macro
   
   Displays    an    editor   macro   (defined   with   ^X()   the   same   as
   show-last-editor-macro  does,  but takes the name assigned to the macro (by
   save-macro) as an argument.
   
esc-X speedtype
   
   Enter  speedtype  minor  mode in this buffer.  Speedtype allows words to be
   used   as   abbreviations  for  other  words.   setab  is  used  to  define
   abbreviations;  When  a  space,  newline, tab, or punctuation mark is typed
   after  an  abbreviation,  the abbreviation is removed from the text and its
   expansion  is  used  instead.   Precede  punctuation  or  spaces with ^Q to
   deliberately avoid speedtype expansion when in this mode.
   
esc-X speedtypeoff
   
   Turn off speedtype mode in this buffer, if it is on.
   
esc-X text-mode

   Mode for editing text files.  Turns on fill mode automatically.  Equivalent
   to the runoff-mode and compose-mode commands; entered automatically for
   files with a last component of ".runoff" or ".compin" if the option
   find-file-set-modes is On (Default is Off).

This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc.,
