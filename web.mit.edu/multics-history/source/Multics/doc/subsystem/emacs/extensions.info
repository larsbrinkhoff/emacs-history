     An editor _e_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n is a user-provided capability, added to the
editor which augments its power and repertoire.  It is different from a
macro, which is simply a collection of editor commands gathered up and
(perhaps) given a name.  Extensions are _p_r_o_g_r_a_m_s; in Multics Emacs,
they are written in the language of the Multics Emacs environment.  One good
definition of an extension is a body of code which augments the editor's
capability, but does not need to know how data in the editor is stored or
manipulated.  In this sense, all of the word, sentence, paragraph,
Lisp-list commands, and the various "modes" (e.g., PL/I mode) are extensions.

     The person who wishes to add to his Multics Emacs environment any
powerful or sophisticated capability must learn to write extensions.  The 
keyboard macro facility (^X(, ^X)), is not intended for such usage.  In this 
document we explain how to write extensions.

     One of the guiding design principles in the Multics Emacs editor was
that the creations of editor extensions, either by the editor implementors or
end users, should be in a programming language of established elegance and
power.  This primer will give you a starting point for writing Lisp code to
run as editor extensions in the Multics Emacs environment.  If you have some
knowledge of Lisp already, it will be of value.  However, I shall assume that
the reader has no familiarity with Lisp, but perhaps with PL/I or BASIC.

     I will assume that the reader _i_s quite familiar with Multics Emacs as 
far as having used it, and acquired some proficiency and familiarity with its 
general usage and visible organization.



          An Introduction to Lisp for People Who Don't Want
          To Have to Know Lisp to Write Emacs extensions.
          -----------------------------------------------

     Lisp programs are built of _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n_s, which are vaguely like procedures 
or subroutines in other languages, although more akin to PL/I and ALGOL 
functions.  We write a Lisp program by creating a file full of function 
_d_e_f_i_n_i_t_i_o_n_s.  A function definition specifies the name of a function, and 
what it does.  Here is a sample function definition:

(defun addandmult (a b c)			;Here is a comment
       (* (- a b)
	(+ a b c)))

This says, "Here is a function named addandmult.  It takes three arguments,
which, as parameters, we will call a, b, and c.  Compute the result of 
multiplying the difference of a and b by the sum of a, b, and c.  Return that 
number as a _r_e_s_u_l_t, or _v_a_l_u_e.

     Here is another function definition:

(defun squareprint (arg)
       (print "The square of")
       (print arg)
       (print "is")
       (print (* arg arg))
       5)

     This function, when invoked, will print the message "The square of",
print the value of its argument, print the word "is", and print the value of
the square of its argument.  It _r_e_t_u_r_n_s the value 5.  The function
"squareprint" has side effects: it causes output on the console.  It also
returns a value, the number 5.  Note that all Lisp functions produce a value;
only some produce side effects.  The first function we defined returns the
product of those numbers as a value; the second returns 5.

     If we look at squareprint, we see that it almost consists of 
"statements", the "print statements" that print things.  These statements
are called _f_o_r_m_s, and what they are in fact are calls to _o_t_h_e_r functions, in 
this case the built-in _p_r_i_n_t function.  In the form

	(print "The square of")

the print function is being passed as an argument the string "The square of".
Like all functions, _p_r_i_n_t will return a value, in
this case, something which we will not use.  The side-effect of
printing something will occur.  In the form

	(+ a b c)

we are asking to invoke the "+" function, which is also built-in, passing it
as arguments the values of the parameter-variables a, b, and c.  It will
return a value, which is the requested sum, and produce no side effects.

     There are five forms in the function-definition for _s_q_u_a_r_e_p_r_i_n_t:

       (print "The square of")
       (print arg)
       (print "is")
       (print (* arg arg))
       5

      Forms immediately inside a function definition are executed
sequentially, like statements in other programming languages.  The value
produced by the last form is the one the function itself returns.  What does
it mean to "execute" a 5? "Execute" is not exactly the right term, that is
where the problem lies.  What really happens is that these forms are
_e_v_a_l_u_a_t_e_d.  This means that a value is produced from them.  Evaluating a 5
produces the number 5; evaluating the form

      (+ a b c)

calls the "+" function with the appropriate arguments, and produces whatever 
value the "+" function returns.  The value produced by the "print" function 
is something which is not interesting, but a value is produced.

     Numbers, like 5, and strings, like "The square of" are said to evaluate 
to themselves.  Things between parentheses, like

     (+ a b c)
     (print "The square of")

are calls to functions, which are evaluated by calling the function 
indicated, and producing the value it returns.  Function calls have the syntax

    (FUNCTIONNAME ARGFORM1 ARGFORM2 ARGFORM3 ... ARGFORMn)

FUNCTIONNAME is the name of the function to call; the ARGFORMs are themselves 
forms, which will be evaluated to produce the arguments to give to the 
function.  Thus, we see that to evaluate (i.e., "execute" and find the value
returned by so executing) a form like

    (+    (*  a  b)
	15
	c)

     We evaluate the _i_n_n_e_r _f_o_r_m (* a b) to produce a value,
     We evaluate the 15 to produce 15 (remember, numbers and strings evaluate
        to themselves)
     We evaluate the _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e c to produce its value,

       And pass these three values on to the "+" function, and return what
       it returns.

     Thus, forms are seen to be either numbers like 5, strings like "is",
variables like b, or function calls like (* a b).

     Variables are much like variables in other languages. A variable has a 
value, which is called its _b_i_n_d_i_n_g.  At this stage of the exposition, this 
value must be a string or a number.  When a function is invoked, the 
parameter variables (like a, b, and c above) of the function acquire the
arguments of the function call as bindings.  Evaluating a variable produces
its binding as a value.  For instance, if someplace in a function we cause
the form

	(addandmult 2 (+ 3 2) 6)

to be evaluated, a, b, and c will have the bindings 2, 5, and 6 while
the forms in the definition of _a_d_d_a_n_d_m_u_l_t are being evaluated.  This is not 
unlike the subroutine parameter mechanism in other languages.  It is very
different insofar that it specifies what _v_a_l_u_e a variable has during 
"subroutine" execution.  In PL/I or FORTRAN, a parameter is associated with
a variable in the calling program, not a value, during subroutine execution.

     There are parameter variables, as we have used above, temporary 
variables, which we will meet below, and global variables.  Regardless of 
what "kind" of variable we are dealing with, they all have bindings (values), 
and evaluation of the variable produces that value.

     Summarizing our naive introduction to dataless Lisp:

     1. Lisp programs are built of functions.

     2. Function definitions consist of the word "defun", the
        function's name, a "parameter list", and a number of forms, which
        are to be sequentially evaluated at function call time, with
        a pair or parentheses around the whole thing.

     3. The value of the last form in a function will be the value returned
        by that function.

     4. Forms can be either strings, numbers, variables or calls on functions.
        Forms are _e_v_a_l_u_a_t_e_d to produce values,
        which are passed around between functions as arguments and results.

     5. Strings and numbers evaluate to themselves.

     6. Variables evaluate to the datum to which they are bound, which,
        for a parameter, is the corresponding argument to the containing
        function.

     7. Function calls contain the name of a function to call and
        forms which are evaluated to produce the arguments to the
        function.  Function calls may produce side-effects.  Like any form,
        when a function call is evaluated, it produces a value.




			    P__r_e_d_i_c_a_t_e_s

     Programming languages need conditional execution.  In order to control 
conditional execution, we need things upon which to base a decision.  There 
are two data objects in the Lisp world corresponding to truth and falsity, 
for the purposes of parts of the Lisp system that deal with conditions.
There are a set of functions called _p_r_e_d_i_c_a_t_e_s which return these objects as 
values.  For instance, there is a function called ">" which, invoked as

    (> 4 6)

will return the indicator of falsity, and when invoked as

    (> 4 1)

will return the indicator of truth.   Predicates work just like other
built-in and non built-in functions, like print, addandmult, squareprint, 
and +.  They take arguments, and produce a result.  In the case of
predicates, however, the result is not a string or a number, but
an indication of truth or falsity.  The result of a predicate can be used
by the "_i_f special form" to control the execution of a function, and we
will consider _i_f shortly.

     Here are some of the most useful Lisp predicates.  In all of these
examples, A1, A2, S1, O1, etc., stand for _f_o_r_m_s, which means they
can be 12, (+ 6 q), (myfun 33 (- a b)), etc.  When we say below that
"A1 is a number" below, what re really are trying to say is that A1
is some form which _e_v_a_l_u_a_t_e_s to a number, such as 3, (+ 6 2),
or x49, if x49's value is indeed a number.

     Predicates for numbers:  A1 and A2 are numbers:

  Predicate   Example   Returns TRUTH if ..., otherwise falsity.
  _________   _______   ________________________________________

     =	    (= A1 A2)     A1 and A2 are the same number.
     >	    (> A1 A2)     A1 is a bigger number than A2.
     <        (< A1 A2)     A1 is a smaller number than A2.

     Predicates for strings: S1 and S2 are strings:

     samepnamep
              (samepnamep S1 S2)   S1 and S2 are strings of identical
			content, i.e., the "same string".  This is
			the standard way to see if two strings are
			the same, as in (samepnamep test "-hold")
     alphalessp
	    (alphalessp S1 S2)   S1 collates before S2 alphabetically, e.g.,
			(alphalessp "Able" "Baker") returns truth, but
			(alphalessp "Zeke" "Joe") does not.

     Predicate for symbols (including character objects), which we will
     learn more about later: SY1 and SY2 are symbols.

     eq       (eq SY1 SY2)    SY1 and SY2 are the same symbol.

     Predicates for any objects: O1 is some object, of perhaps unknown type:

     fixp     (fixp O1)       O1 is a number, as opposed to some other kind
			of object.
     stringp  (stringp O1)    O1 is a string, as opposed to anything else.
     symbolp  (symbolp O1)    O1 is a symbol, as opposed to anything else.
     null     (null O1)       O1 is not only a symbol, but the very important
		          and critical symbol named "nil".

			Lisp Special Forms
		      -------------------------

     Now there are a number of _s_p_e_c_i_a_l _f_o_r_m_s in Lisp, which do not go by the 
simple rules given above.  We have already seen one.  The function-defining 
form, which begins with the word "defun", is not simply a function call with 
forms to produce the function's arguments.  By all rights, a form like

   (defun square (x)
	(* x x))

should, when evaluated, evaluate, in order, to produce arguments for "defun",

       1. A variable named "square".
       2. The form "(x)", calling a function named "x" with no arguments.
       3. The form "(* x x)", multiplying the value of a variable named "x"
          by itself,

and then pass these three values onto the "defun" function.  This, however
is not actually what happens.  Evaluating the "defun" form causes a function
named "square" to be defined, whose parameter list and "body" are as given.
Defun is a _s_p_e_c_i_a_l _f_o_r_m, and when Lisp sees "defun" as the function-name in a 
form it has been asked to evaluate, it says "Stop everything, I'm going to 
do something special with this, in this case, define a _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n built out of 
this _f_o_r_m _i_t_s_e_l_f."  It is _n_o_t a call to "defun" with arguments.  Although 
this may seem kludgey at first, it can be shown that one must have at least 
one such special form in order to have an operative Lisp system of any kind.

     There is a special form in the Multics Emacs Lisp environment called _i_f, 
which is used to control conditional execution (conditional evaluation).  
Here is an example of its use:

(defun which-is-greater (first second)
       (if (> first second)
	 (print "The first one is the greater.")
         else
	 (if (> second first)
	     (print "The second one is greater")
	   else
	     (print "They are equal")))

The syntax of _i_f is as follows:

     (if <PREDICATE>
         <THEN-FORM-1>
         <THEN-FORM-2>
             ...
         <THEN-FORM-m>
       else
         <ELSE-FORM-1>
         <ELSE-FORM-2>
             ...
         <ELSE-FORM-n>   )

     Any number, including none, "THEN-FORM"s may be supplied.  Similarly,
any number, including none, of the "ELSE-FORM"s may be given.  If there are
no "ELSE-FORM"s, then the keyword "else" may be omitted, too.

     Note that all the forms in the _i_f are _n_o_t sequentially evaluated; the 
word _e_l_s_e is not even intended to be a form.  If all of the forms inside the 
_i_f were evaluated, it would be useless, for execution (evaluation) would not 
be conditional.   That is why _i_f is a special form; there are special rules 
about how forms inside it are to be evaluated.  The rule for all non-special 
forms is the same: you evaluate all the sub-forms sequentially to produce the 
arguments to the function.

     The _i_f special form evaluates the <PREDICATE>: if it results in truth,
the <THEN-FORM>s are sequentially evaluated, and the value of the last one is 
returned as the value of the _i_f.  Otherwise, the <ELSE-FORM>s are evaluated 
sequentially, and the value of the last returned.  If there are none, 
something useless is returned (nil, to those knowledgeable in Lisp).

     There are two global variables in Lisp, called "t" and "nil", whose
bindings are always the truth and falsity indicators respectively.  Thus,

   (if t
       (print "Truth")
     else
       (print "Not so truth"))

when evaluated, will always print "Truth".

     There is a way to change the value of a variable.  The only way we have 
seen so far that variables acquire values is by being parameters, and 
acquiring values at function call time.  Values can be changed by the special 
form _s_e_t_q:

(defun adder-of-one ()
       (print "The value of x is")
       (print x)
       ("And the value of x plus one is")
       (setq x (+ x 1))
       (print x))

A _s_e_t_q form has the word _s_e_t_q, the name of a variable, and an inside form.  
The inside form is evaluated, and that value assigned to the variable.  It is 
like an assignment statement in other languages.

     There is a construct for looping in the Multics Emacs Lisp environment.  
It, too, is a special form.  It is called "do-forever":

(do-forever
    (print "Yay Multics")
    (print "scitluM yaY"))

will, when evaluated, print these two sayings forever.  The way you stop
doing in a do-forever is to evaluate the form "(stop-doing)":

(defun print-n-times (n)
       (do-forever
         (if (= n 0)(stop-doing))
         (print "foo")
         (setq n (- n 1))))

This function, given a number as an argument, will print "foo" that many 
times. The "=" builtin function/predicate compares its two arguments, which 
must be numbers, and returns truth or falsity depending on whether or not they 
are numerically equal. Note that the arguments to "=" are _n_o_t n and 0, but 
rather, the number which is the binding of n and 0.  The number which is the 
binding of n is different each time around the loop; that is the point of the 
program.  It is _s_e_t_q which changes the value of n each time around, as
do-forever executes the loop.  A "do-forever" form generally returns something 
useless (nil), unless you exit by saying (return 5) or (return nil), or
(return a), in which latter case the value of the variable a is returned.

     One can acquire temporary variables via the special form "let":

(defun sumtimesdif (x y)
   (let ((sum (+ x y))
         (dif (- x y)))
        (print "Sum times difference is ")
        (print (* sum dif))
        (print "Sum squared is")
        (print (* sum sum))))
    
This function has two temporary variables, sum and dif, which are 
initialized to the values of (+ x y) and (- x y).  The general syntax of
"let" is:

     (let ((VAR1 VAL1)
	 (VAR2 VAL2)
	 ...........
	 (VARn VALn))
	<FORM1>
	<FORM2>
	.......
	<FORMm>)

     The temporary variables VAR1...VARn exist only within the _l_e_t.  They get 
the initial values of VAL1-VALn, which are forms that will be evaluated.
Then, with all these temporary variables set up and initialized, the FORMi's
are evaluated sequentially, and the value of the last FORMi is returned by _l_e_t.

     Another, less useful way of acquiring temporary variables is via the
special form _p_r_o_g.  Forms inside a _p_r_o_g are evaluated sequentially, like
forms in a function definition.  However, the first "form" in a _p_r_o_g is not
really a form at all, but rather a list of temporary variables used in the
_p_r_o_g, such as "(a b c)".  That is why _p_r_o_g is a special form.  The value
returned by _p_r_o_g is usually useless, unless (return...) is used to return
something meaningful.

     Inside a _p_r_o_g, one can also put "labels", to use for 
go-to's:

(defun bar2 (x y)
       (prog ()			;note the empty variable list
	   (if (< x y)(go lab1))
	   (print "X is not less than Y")
	   (return nil)		;return "false" indication
        lab1
	   (print "so be it!")
	   (return t)))		;return "true" indication.

Note the special form _g_o, whose _o_p_e_r_a_n_d (_n_o_t argument)
is a _l_a_b_e_l to which to "go", i.e., continue sequential evaluation of forms in 
the prog.  You wil find that labels are rarely needed, due to the powerful
_i_f and _d_o-___f_o_r_e_v_e_r constructs.

     There are special forms for or-ing and and-ing predicate results: they 
are special because they stop evaluating their operands (from which arguments 
are produced) when they "know" their answer for certain:

    (if (and (not (= x 0))
	   (> (// 10 x) 5))
        (print "Quotient too large."))

The _n_o_t function inverts truth and falsity.
The double-slash indicates division, because slash is the escape character in 
Lisp.

     Note that the _a_n_d will not attempt to evaluate the second form within it 
if the first produces falsity.  This prevents an error which would result if 
an attempt were made to divide by zero.   Sequential execution and stopping
at an intermediate result are a defined and useful feature here, as opposed 
to the logical operators of, say, PL/I.

     There are two more special forms worth mentioning while we are on the
topic, progn and prog2.  _p_r_o_g_n is used to force sequential execution of forms
and returning the value of the last.  For instance,

(if (and (> x 3)
         (progn (print "Oh dear this is getting serious")
	      (> y 5))
         (print "Fatal difficulty")))

_p_r_o_g_n returns the value of its last form.  Thus, the _a_n_d tests x being 
greater than 3, and y being greater than 5, before the "print" of "Fatal 
difficulty" is evaluated.  The printing of "Oh dear..." occurs as part of the 
evaluation of the _p_r_o_g_n, it is only the second value in the progn which _a_n_d 
gets to see.  The _p_r_o_g_n is used to force evaluation of the _p_r_i_n_t form.

     _p_r_o_g2_ is even a bit stranger, but often just the thing one needs.  _p_r_o_g2_
is just like _p_r_o_g_n, except that it returns its _s_e_c_o_n_d argument, evaluated,
rather than its last.  It must have at least two arguments.  It is used for
clever tricks that involve saving some value which is subsequently going to
be destroyed.  The following form, when evaluated, interchanges the values of
x and y:

(setq x (prog2 0			; this zero is evaluated to 0, and
				; its value thrown away.
	     y			; the value of y is obtained here, and
				; remembered as it is here.
	     (setq y x)))		; x is evaluated, and that value 
				; assigned  to y. The value of setq
				; is that value.
	; But the value of the _p_r_o_g2_ is that value of y as it was before we 
	; assigned into y, and now the outer setq assigns that to x.


			     S__y_m_b_o_l_s

     There is one more type of data object in Lisp that will concern us at
present.  It is called the _s_y_m_b_o_l.  Symbols are named data objects kept in a
registry of symbols, by Lisp.  For current purposes, there is only one symbol
of any name.  Symbols are used in Multics Emacs to represent buffer names,
and various quantities associated with buffers.  Lisp uses symbols to keep 
track of functions, and internally to keep track of global variables.

     To use a symbol in a program, we give the name of the symbol preceded by 
the ASCII quote character, '.  For instance,  the form

(setq x 'Brunhilde)

assigns the symbol named Brunhilde to x.  Note that this is different
from

(setq x "Brunhilde")

which assigns the _s_t_r_i_n_g Brunhilde to x, and from

(setq x Brunhilde)

which assigns the value of the variable Brunhilde to x.

			L__i_s_p L__i_s_t_s

     The final data-type of Lisp with which we will have reason to deal is the
_c_o_n_s (for construct), and the larger data-type built out of it, the _l_i_s_t.
Conses are blocks which relate to two (usually other) objects in the
environment, which are known as its _c_a_r and its _c_d_r, for historical reasons.
The function "cons", given two objects, produces a new cons, whose car and
cdr, respectively, are the two objects given.  For instance, let's say
that the variable "x" has a value of the string "Brunhilde", as above,
then

	(cons 7 x)

produces a cons whose car is the number 7 and whose cdr is the string
"Brunhilde", returning it as a value.  The functions "car" and "cdr"
may be used to obtain the car and cdr of a cons.  Let us say that we had
set the variable "c" to the result of the form (cons 7 x) above, then

	(car c)

produces the number 7 as a value.

     The usual thing to do with conses is to make larger and larger structures
out of conses, by setting up conses whose car and cdr are more conses,
and so forth, until we have a large enough structure to represent all the
values we need.  The resulting construction serves the same purpose
as a PL/I structure: its various parts have meaning assigned by the
programmer.

     The most common construction of conses is the "list".  A list
is defined as a chain of conses, each of which has the next one
in the chain as its cdr, except the last one, which has the symbol "nil"
as its cdr.  A list built in this way of n conses is called a list of n
_e_l_e_m_e_n_t_s, the elements being the n objects which are the cars of the conses.
The cons at the head of the list is identified as being "the list": its
car is the first element in the list, its cdr is the cons whose
car is the second element of the list, and so forth.  Let us
construct a list of the numbers 2, 4, 5, and 7, in that order, and
set the variable "b" to it:

	(setq b (cons 2 (cons 4 (cons 5 (cons 7 nil)))))

(Note that the variable "nil" is peculiar insofar as its value is always
the symbol "nil", thus we need not say 'nil.)

There is a function that simplifies the writing of such forms, for
constructing lists: it builds lists directly, and accepts any number
of arguments.  It produces the same result as the type of construction
shown above.  It is called "list":

	(setq b (list 2 4 5 7))

To get the third element of the list, once this form were evaluated, we
could evaluate the form

	(car (cdr (cdr b)))

(ie.e, the car of the cons which is the cdr of the cons which is the
cdr of the cons which is the value of b).  Again, there are
Lisp functions to simplify such constructions.  The above form
is equivalent to

	(caddr b)

In general, for up to 4 car's and cdr's deep, total, functions
like cadr, cdar, caddr, cadar and so forth, are provided (up through caaaar
and cddddr).  The first four elements of a list are gotten by
car, cadr, caddr, and cadddr (it is good exercise to work that
through and verify why this is the case).

     When lists are printed out by Lisp, they are represented
as a pair of parentheses around the printed representations of all
of the elements, in sequence, separated by spaces.  Thus, if
Lisp printed out the list which was b's value above, it would
appear

	(2 4 5 7)

Conses whose cdr is the symbol nil may always be viewed as lists
of one item, and are so printed out by Lisp, unless it is in the
process of printing a larger list of which the cons at issue is
a chain-link.  Conses whose cdr is neither nil nor another cons
are printed with a dot preceding the cdr. Thus:

	(cons 'a 'b)  =>  (a . b)
	(cons 'a nil) =>  (a)		;a list of one element
	(cons 'a (cons 'b 'c)) => (a b . c)
	(cons 'a (cons 'b nil)) => (a b)	;list of two elements
	(cons 'a (cons (cons 'b 'c)(cons 'd nil))) ;list of three
		=> (a (b . c) d)

Lists can be put into programs, by quoting them, as we quote symbols:

	(setq b1 '(this is (a list)(of lists)))

Two functions are provided to redefine the car or cdr of an existing cons.
They can be very dangerous if misused, especially if they alter a list as in
the form above, which is written into a program as a constant.  rplaca
(replace car) and rplacd (replace cdr) each take two arguments, the first is
the cons which is to be altered, and the second is the new car or new cdr
respectively.  the returned value is the cons itself.

     The starting point for writing extensions is building functions out of
provided functions in the Emacs Lisp environment, and hooking them
up to keys.  The documented set-key and set-permanent-key commands can be
used to connect keys to Lisp functions that you provide, as well as to
provided commands and keyboard macros.

     Many simple and useful extensions are just groups of provided commands 
strung together.  For instance, suppose that we want to write a function that 
goes to the beginning of a line, deletes all whitespace there, goes to the end 
of the line, does the same, and then goes back to the beginning of the line.

     Interactively, we would type;

	^A ESC-\ ^E ESC-\ ^A

to do this.  To write such a function, called "shave-line", let us say, we 
would write this:

(defun shave-line ()		;keystroke functions take no args.
       (go-to-beginning-of-line)
       (delete-white-sides)
       (go-to-end-of-line)
       (delete-white-sides)
       (go-to-beginning-of-line))

Write this function in a file, with the editor of your choice.  When in 
Emacs, say ESC-X loadfile PATHNAME CR, to load it in as code.  Then hook it 
up, perhaps by saying

       ESC-X set-key ^XA shave-line CR

Then, hitting ^XA will cause the chosen sequence of actions to happen.  In 
order to find out the names of the functions that we had to use to code shave-
line, all we had to do is ask ESC-? what the names of the functions on ^A,
^E, and ESC-\ were.

     Now we want to be able to do more complex things, like use conditionals 
and variables.  Let us say that we wanted a function that went to the 
beginning of a line and deleted all words that started with "foo" from the 
beginning of the line.

(%include e-macros)

(defun foodeleter ()
       (go-to-beginning-of-line)
       (do-forever
	(if (looking-at "foo")
	    (delete-word)
	    (delete-white-sides)
	  else (stop-doing))))

The (%include e-macros) must be at the beginning of any file that uses the 
Emacs environment Lisp macros.   The file e-macros.incl.lisp is found in the 
same directory as the editor.  It should be in your "translator" search path
in order to do any Emacs extension development work.

    What this function does in essence is type ^A, and as long as the first 
three characters on the line are "foo", does ESC-D's followed by ESC-\ to 
remove the whitespace after the word.  When the first three characters are no 
longer "foo", it will return.  "looking-at" is an Emacs predicate (to be 
described in detail below) which tests whether a given string is to the right 
of the current "cursor".  We will no longer discuss the issue of how to hook 
this or any other function up to a given key; we have already covered that 
adequately.  From this point on, we will only discuss coding functions.

     If you write the function foodeleter, hook it up to a key and use it, 
you will watch all foo-starting words magically disappear at once from the 
begninning of a line with foo-starting words at its front, when you strike 
this key.  Note that the code for foodeleter has no mention of printing,
output, or displays.  It cares and or knows exactly as much about them as you 
do when typing Emacs keystroke commands.  It just manipulates the text in the 
buffer, and the screen or printing terminal is managed automatically by the 
magic of the Multics Emacs redisplay.  The display need never be thought 
about in coding Emacs extensions.

     It is a major intentional feature that many of the commands that are 
connected to keys can be, and should be used in coding extensions.
go-to-end-of-line, go-to-beginning-of-buffer, skip-over-indentation,
forward-char, and delete-word are typical of them.  There are some commands, 
however, that should not be used from extension code.  For example, if you
wanted to search for some string, you do not want to invoke
string-search, which is what ^S is connected to, for that will prompt
the user in the minibuffer for what to search for.  Here is a table of
some keystroke commands that you should not use in extensions, what you 
should use instead, and why:

KEY	DONT USE		USE INSTEAD	WHY

^N	next-line-command	next-line		next-line command worries
					about screen position,
					which is expensive and
					usually not needed.
					Also worries about
					numeric arguments.

^P	prev-line-command	prev-line		Same reasons as above.

^K	kill-lines	kill-to-end-of-line
			delete-char (at eol)
					^K is very complex, has
					many cases, worries about
					numeric arguments.

^S	string-search	forward-search	forward-search takes string
					as Lisp argument, does not 
					prompt.  Moves "cursor" if
					search succeeds; returns 
					truth or falsity to indicate
					result.

^R	reverse-string-search
			reverse-search	Same as ^S.

^X^R	read-file		read-in-file	read-in-file takes Lisp
					argument for pathname,
					does not prompt.

^X^W	write-file	write-out-file	Same as ^X^R.

^W	wipe-region	wipe-point-mark	Use local marks, see below.

ESC-/	regexp-search-command
			regexp-search	Same arguments as ^S. Takes
					Lisp argument, no slashes.
					Returns falsity if not found
					or moves cursor to after
					and returns mark to before
					matched string if found.

^XB	select-buffer       go-to-or-create-buffer  Takes arg, doesn't prompt

^X^F	find-file		find-file-subr      Ditto.

	This list is probably not complete, but these are the important
ones to know.

	Commands whose behavior is indistinguishable between ESC-5-<FOO>
and <FOO><FOO><FOO><FOO><FOO>, i.e., ^B, ^D, ^F, ESC-B, ESC-D, ESC-F,
#, ESC-#, etc., are OK to use in extensions;  they do not inspect their
arguments.  They are invoked multiple times by the Emacs listener if 
appropriate.   Commands whose names include the word "command" (other than
^G, command-quit) are usually not intended to be used in code.

     The value of the numeric command argument, i.e., "5" in ESC-5-<FOO>,
is available as the binding of the global variable "numarg"; if there was no
numeric argument given, this variable is set to the symbol "nil" (not to be 
confused with the global variable nil, whose binding is the symbol nil) which,
we now disclose, is _t_h_e representation of falsity.

     The normal printing characters are hooked up to the function
self-insert, which inserts the last physical character typed at the current
point in the buffer.  This is clearly unusable from code, if your desire is 
to insert text into the buffer.  For this purpose, the Emacs environment 
provides the function "insert-string", whose argument is a string to be 
inserted  into the buffer at the current cursor.  As in typing in text 
manually, the cursor is left after the inserted text:

(defun make-a-point ()
       (go-to-beginning-of-line)
       (insert-string "CASE IN POINT:   "))

     make-a-point, when invoked, goes to the beginning of the line, and 
inserts the string "CASE IN POINT:   " in the buffer.  The cursor is left 
after the inserted string.

    When we say "the cursor is moved around" or "a string is inserted" in a 
function, we do not imply that the user watching the screen can see all these 
things happen.  No action on the screen occurs until the entire function has 
finished running, at which time, the screen is updated all at once, as 
appropriate, showing the total, cumulative effect of what has happened, 
regardless of how it happened.

		      M__a_r_k_s _a_n_d _t_h_e_i_r M__a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t

     A concept of great value is that of the "mark", or, as it is called in
other Emacs-like editors, the editor buffer pointer.  Like the cursor, a mark 
is a conceptual pointer to the position between two characters in the current 
buffer.  Marks, like the cursor, have the property that they remain between 
the two characters between which they were put regardless of other insertions 
or deletions in the same buffer, even on the same line as the mark.  Marks 
are valuable because regions of text in the buffer are specified as the 
extent between the current conceptual cursor, hereafter known as "point", and 
a given mark.  Marks are a type of data object in the Multics Emacs Lisp 
environment, like strings, numbers,and symbols.  The value of any variable 
may be made to be a mark.  The value of many variables might even be the same 
mark! The "the-mark" spoken of in the documentation is just one mark, that
is the value of a global variable that many supplied functions know about.
Emacs functions use many temporary marks.

     The function set-mark creates a new mark, which points to the current 
"point" in the current buffer.  It stays around, and is updated by the editor, 
any time text is inserted or deleted in this buffer.  Since this is 
expensive, we must take care to discard, or _r_e_l_e_a_s_e marks when we are done 
using them.  This is done by giving them to the function release-mark.  Here 
is an example of a function which deletes three words and all between them:

(defun delete-three-words ()
       (let ((temp-mark (set-mark)))	 ;make a mark in a temp var.
	   (do-times 3 (forward-word)) ;3 words forward
	   (wipe-point-mark temp-mark) ;wipe out the stuff between point
				;and where point was.
	   (release-mark temp-mark)))

The variable temp-mark is set to a mark representing the "point" at the time 
delete-three-words is entered. "do-times" is a very useful construct in the
Multics Emacs Lisp environment, that repeats the evaluation of one or more 
forms a given number of times. Its syntax is:

    (do-times <HOWMANY> <FORM1> <FORM2> .. <FORMn>)

wipe-point-mark is a function which, given a mark, takes all the text between
"point" at the time it is invoked and that mark (i.e., "point" at the time 
that mark was created) and deletes it from the buffer.  It is, however, 
pushed on to the  kill ring, so that ^Y can be used to retrieve it.  If we 
did not want it pushed onto the kill ring, we could have said

    (without-saving (wipe-point-mark temp-mark))

instead of

   (wipe-point-mark temp-mark)

and no saving would have occured.  After we perform the computation, we free 
up the mark, to keep the performance of the editor up.

     The sequence of setting a mark, using it, and releasing it, is so common
that a special construct in the Multics Emacs Lisp environment is provided
which takes care of all of this, including the creation of a temporary
variable, so no _p_r_o_g or _l_e_t is needed.  It is called
"with-mark".  The function delete-three-words, rewrtitten to use it, looks 
like this:

(defun delete-three-words ()
       (with-mark m		;m is usually used for the name of a mark.
	        (do-times 3 (forward-word))
	        (wipe-point-mark m)))

The with-mark construct is very powerful and useful.  Its syntax is
(the word "syntax" is a tip-off to a special form):

   (with-mark <MARKNAME>
      <FORM1>
      <FORM2>
        ...
      <FORMn> )

It means:  "Where I am now, call that <MARKNAME>.  Evaluate (execute)
the forms <FORM1> to <FORMN>, sequentially, returning the value of the last 
one as a value.  Before returning anything, however, free up the mark I made".

     A very common use of marks is to remember where you were at the time you 
started something, and after some traveling around, get back there when you 
are finished doing it. Here is an example of a function which truncates a 
line which is longer than 50 print positions, with backspaces and tabs all 
considered properly:

(defun trunc-50 ()
     (with-mark m			;remember where we started
       (go-to-end-of-line)
       (if (> (cur-hpos) 50.)		; dot is for decimal, default is octal
	 (go-to-hpos 50.)
	 (kill-to-end-of-line))	;what ^K does not at e.o.l.
       (go-to-mark m)))		;return to where we were

     Several things are worth noting here.  "cur-hpos" is a very valuable 
function which tells you the horizontal position (on a dprint, not on the 
screen) of the current "point" (the left margin is considered to be 0).
As can be seen from the from "(cur-hpos)", it takes no arguments.  The 
function go-to-hpos  moves point to a position on the current line whose 
horizontal position is its argument, or the end of the line, if the line is 
shorter than that.

     Now "(go-to-mark m)" is not some kind of a branch, but tells the editor 
to move the current point in this buffer to the point where it was at the time
the mark, to which the variable m is bound, was created.

     Although moving the editor's point to previously saved marks is 
extremely common, just using the mark mechanism to remember where you were 
before some excursion and get back there is so common that a special 
mechanism is provided just for this: it is called save-excursion, and it deals
with all the issues of temporary variables and releasing the mark when done.
Our function trunc-50 recoded to use it looks like this:

(defun trunc-50 ()
       (save-excursion
	(go-to-end-of-line)
	(if (> (cur-hpos) 50.)
	    (go-to-hpos 50.)
	    (kill-to-end-of-line))))

The semantics of the save-excursion special form are as follows: Remember
where I am, via a mark saved in a secret internal variable.  Evaluate all of
the forms within the save-excursion, and return as a value the value of the
last one.  Before returning anything however, move the editor point back to 
where it was when the save-excursion was first "entered", and release the 
mark used to remember this place.


     Note that if point were at print position 75. at the time trunc-50
was called, it will wind up at position 50, even though the mark to which it
wants to return points to what was at position 75.  No error is indicated, or 
has occured.  Marks live, even if characters to the right or left of them are 
deleted.


			C__l_e_a_n_u_p H__a_n_d_l_e_r_s

     You may have wondered, in the previous section, what happens if an
extension encounters an error while executing, and never gets to release
a mark it has set.   When errors occur (for example, forward-char (^F)'ing
off the end of the buffer), Emacs aborts execution of command functions,
returns to its listener, and beeps (as when a ^G is performed), as you
know, if you have ever tried to ^V off the end of a buffer, or so forth.

     Since the releasing of marks has been pointed out as mildly critical,
there is a need for a "cleanup-handler"-like facility to make sure that
marks get release when code is aborted.  Indeed, there is such a facility
in Lisp, and we will explain its use summarily.  This cleanup-handler
facility is useful for many other things, too: "save-excursion" returns
the cursor to the point at which it found it, if aborted through,
save-excursion-buffer returns to the buffer where it found the editor
if aborted through, all the mark-handling forms release their mark,
and so forth.  These Emacs-environment primitives use the cleanup-handler
facility internally, so we need not worry about cleanup-handlers if we
use them.  However, occasionally, there are times (see the code
for columnating the Emacs wall chart, for example) when we must use
cleanup-handlers explicitly.  The Lisp form "unwind-protect"
is the primitive cleanup-handler.  Here is its syntax:

     (unwind-protect
	<SUBJECTFORM>
	<CLEANUPFORM1>
	<CLEANUPFORM2>
	...
	<CLEANUPFORMn>)

The meaning of this is as follows: The <SUBJECTFORM> is evaluated, i.e.,
executed,  and then <CLEANUPFORM1> to <CLEANUPFORMn> (any number of cleanup
forms are permissible), and the value of the <SUBJECTFORM> returned.
So far, unwind-protect is very much like _p_r_o_g2_ or _p_r_o_g_n.  The difference,
however, is that <CLEANUPFORM1> to <CLEANUPFORMn> will be executed even if the
execution of <SUBJECTFORM> fails, and aborts!  Similarly, the cleanup forms
will be executed even if diabolically tricky things like a _r_e_t_u_r_n from a _p_r_o_g
inside the <SUBJECTFORM> causes its execution to terminate prematurely.

     Thus, the cleanup forms are executed after _e_v_e_r_y termination of the
<SUBJECTFORM>, whether normal or abnormal.  The following use of
unwind-protect (which could clearly be done in simpler ways, but is here for
illustrative purposes only) performs "complex-function", and returns the
cursor to the beginning of the buffer, even if "complex-function"
"explodes":

     (unwind-protect
	(complex-function)
	(go-to-beginning-of-buffer))

Note that if you want more than one <SUBJECTFORM>, you had better use
_p_r_o_g_n to encompass them, and make your <SUBJECTFORM> this _p_r_o_g_n.

     Unlike Multics/PL/I cleanup handlers, unwind-protect cleanup forms
will be executed upon normal termination of the subject form, too.
A close inspection of most PL/I programs using cleanup handlers shows
that this may be the better idea after all.


			U__s_e_f_u_l P__r_e_d_i_c_a_t_e_s

     The following predicates in the Multics Emacs environment are basic to 
all extension-writing; they are used to test various hypotheses about point, 
marks, and the buffer:

   (eolp)		;End of line predicate. True if point is at end of a text 
		;line, which is right before the newline character.

   (bolp)		;Beginning of line predicate.  True if point is at the
		;start of a text ine, being either before the first 
		;character of the buffer, or after a newline.

   (firstlinep)	;First line predicate.  True if point is on the first
		;text line of the buffer.

   (lastlinep)	;Last line predicate.  True if on last buffer line.

   (at-beginning-of-buffer)
		;True if point is right before the first character in the
		;buffer

   (at-end-of-buffer)
		;True if point is right before the newline on the last
		;line of the buffer. You can't go past it.

   (looking-at <STRING-VALUE>)
		;True if <STRING-VALUE> appears in the buffer 
		;immediately to the right of point. Restriction:
		;<STRING-VALUE> may not contain a newline character,
		;except as its last character.

   (at-white-char)	;True if the character to the right of point is 
		;a space, newline, or tab.

   (point>markp <MARK>) ;True if the current point is _f_u_r_t_h_e_r in the
		;buffer than the position defined by <MARK>.
		;This is expensive, and should not be used in loops.

   (mark-reached <MARK>)
		;True if the current point is up to or beyond <MARK>
		;in the buffer.  Intended for use in controlling
		;character-by character loops, expects that point
		;starts to the left of <MARK> and moves toward it.
		;The function (order-mark-last <MARK>) may be used
		;to switch point and mark if needed at the start of such
		;loops.  Will not terminate unless executed with mark
		;and point on same line.

   (mark-at-current-point-p <MARK>)
		;True if the mark <MARK> represents the exact same
		;position as the current point.

   (mark-on-current-line-p <MARK>)
		;True if the mark <MARK> represents a position on the
		;same line as the current point.

   (mark-same-line-p <MARK1> <MARK2>)
		;True if two marks which are arguments represent
		;positions on same line.

   (line-is-blank)	;True if current line is all blanks or empty.

   (empty-buffer-p <BUFFER-SYMBOL>)
		;True if the buffer identified by <BUFFER-SYMBOL> is
		;empty, i.e., contains exactly one line with only a 
		;newline character in it.  The form
		;(empty-buffer-p current-buffer) may be used to test
		;the emptiness of the current buffer.  See below
		;for a discussion of buffer symbols.
		    ------------------------------

   Now we use some of this. Here is a function that ltrims all the lines in
the buffer.  There are easier ways, but we are using the primitives and 
constructs we do here for illustrative purposes:

(defun ltrim-all-lines ()
       (save-excursion			;be polite, restore point.
	(go-to-beginning-of-buffer)
	(do-forever			;loop on lines thru buf
	 (do-forever			;loop thru chars on line
	  (if (eolp)(stop-doing))		;stop at eol.
	  (if (at-white-char)(delete-char)	;do the work
	    else (stop-doing)))		;non-white char, next line.
	 (if (lastlinep)(stop-doing))		;quit when did last line
	 (next-line))))			;leaves you at b.o.l.


		        W_H_I_T_E_S_P_A_C_E_ M_A_N_A_G_E_M_E_N_T_

     Management of whitespace is very important. Neatly formatted editor 
output and displays, as well as program and document formatting require this.

     The following functions exist to deal with whitespace:

   skip-over-whitespace
	Takes no arguments.  Moves point forward over all tabs, blanks, and
	newlines until a non-white character or the end of the buffer is
	reached to the right of point.

   skip-back-whitespace
	Takes no arguments.  Moves point backward over all tabs, newlines,
	and blanks until the character to the left of point is not one of
	these, or the beginning of the buffer is reached.

   skip-to-whitespace
	Moves forward until character to right of point is one of tab,
	blank, or newline.  Since last character in buffer must be 
	a newline, there is no special end condition.

   skip-back-to-whitespace
	Moves backward until the character to the right of point is
	one of tab, blank, or newline, or the beginning of the buffer is 
	reached.
	 
   delete-white-sides
	The old standby on ESC-\, this extremely valuable function may be
	used to advantage to delete leading or trailing blanks from
	anything, or delete space between words.

   skip-over-whitespace-in-line
	Same as skip-over-whitespace, but will stop before the newline
	character at the end of the line (i.e., stop at the end of the line)
	if it gets that far.

   skip-back-whitespace-in-line
	Same as skip-back-whitespace, but will not proceed backward
	beyond the beginning of the line.

     A very common need is to generate whitespace to reach a given horizontal 
position (column).  This is good for all kinds of tabbing and page layouts.  
The function whitespace-to-hpos performs this service; it generates tabs and 
spaces as appropriate, moving point along until the horizontal position which 
is its argument is reached.  The following toy function moves all lines in 
the buffer seven spaces over, regardless of their original indentation, with 
just the right amount of tabs and spaces when all is said and done:

(defun move-over-7 ()
       (save-excursion
        (go-to-beginning-of-buffer)		;all do-for-all-lines 
        (do-forever				;start like this.
	      (skip-over-indentation)		;This is ESC-M, which is
					;often useful. Look it up.
	      (let ((hpos (cur-hpos)))	;let hpos be the curr. pos.
		 (delete-white-sides)	;close up all original space
		 (whitespace-to-hpos (+ hpos 7))) ;make just enough
	      (if (lastlinep)(stop-doing))
	      (next-line))))

     A related need is that to space out to a given position with whitespace,
but leaving a single space if you are already there or beyond.  This is
useful for producing columnar output where overlength fields must be
separated (like what ^X^B does).  whitespace-to-hpos will not do this; it
stops if it is far enough.  This need is fulfilled by format-to-col, which
takes a single argument, a horizontal position to be spaced out to.  If the
current point is already that far, it inserts a space.

    The function point-mark-to-string is used to get a Lisp string whose 
value is the string of characters between point and the mark which is its 
argument.  Let us demonstrate with a function that finds a vertical bar  (|) 
on a line, deletes it, and swaps the two line-halves around it.  For instance,
the line

	An Indian with a zebra | never trips in the snow

will come out

	never trips in the snowAn Indian with a zebra

Here is this extremely utilitarian construction:

(defun swap-around-bar ()
       (go-to-beginning-of-line)
       (if (not (forward-search-in-line "|"))	;check for one at all.
	 (display-error "Hey, there is no ""|""!"))
       (rubout-char)			;what # does
       (with-mark m				;m in middle of line
	     (go-to-end-of-line)
	     (let ((temp (point-mark-to-string m))) ;get middle to end
		(without-saving (wipe-point-mark m))
		(go-to-beginning-of-line)
		(insert-string temp)))) 		;put in text

     forward-search-in-line is just like forward-search, except that it
indicates failure if it cannot find its search string in the current line.
If we cannot find the vertical bar, we complain and do command-quit, a "^G",
which stops the execution of this function at once and returns to
command level.  It is often needed, however, to search for some string
only in a given line, and thus, it is useful in its own right.  There is also
a reverse-search-in-line, and a regexp-search-in-line, which are similar in
their relation to ^R and ESC-/.

     We may not use the Lisp I/O system to print out messages and/or query 
the user.  The Multics Emacs redisplay must manage the screen itself, 
entirely.  Thus, you may not use "print", or "read", or other Lisp functions 
that you may be familiar with.

     A function called minibuffer-print is provided, which prints all the
little messages that Emacs outputs in the minibuffer screen area.  It takes
any number of arguments, which must be strings.  The useful function
decimal-rep is provided to convert numbers into strings for purposes of
inserting them in the buffer or handing them to display-error.  The following
function counts the number of a's in the current line:

(defun a-counter ()
    (let ((n 0))				;initial count
         (save-excursion			;why not.
	(go-to-beginning-of-line)
	(do-forever
	 (if (not (forward-search-in-line "a"))
	     (minibuffer-print "I found " (decimal-rep n) " a's.")
	     (stop-doing))
	 (setq n (+ 1 n)))))	;count 'em.

     Note how we take advantage of the fact that forward-search-in-line
moves to the right of what it finds (like ^S, its patron), so that it will not 
find it the next time.

     To prompt the user for input, which is always done via the minibuffer
(other than for ESC-?, which is highly special), the function
minibuf-response is used. It takes two arguments.  The first is the prompting
string.  The second should be specified by the value of one of the global 
variables ESC or NL, which are bound to magic symbols that minibuf-response
knows about.  If the value of ESC is used, minibuffer input will terminate
on an ESC.  If the value of NL is used, (NL, _n_o_t CR), minibuffer input will 
terminate on a carriage return.  There are no other choices. Thus,

      (minibuf-response "Type new division name: " NL)

will return the user's response to this question.  S/he is expected to
terminate it with a carriage return.  The value of minibuf-response is a Lisp
string.  The carriage return will not appear in it, nor will the prompt.

     Often one wants to display an error message in the minibuffer, and then
abort execution of an extension, i.e., execute a command-quit (^G).  For
example, in checking the arguments to an extended command, checking that a
necessary sequence of previous commands were issued before a certain command,
etc.  For this, display-error is provided.  display-error is like
minibuffer-print, except that it does NOT return, but aborts to emacs top
level immediately after printing its error message in the minibuffer.  Like
minibuffer-print, it takes any number of string arguments.

     Messages printed by minibuffer-print are suppressed during keyboard macro
( ^X(, ^X)) execution, just as search strings are not displayed, and other
gratuitous messages are suppressed.   The following set of functions describes
the repertoire of message-printing:


     display-error
	Prints a message in the minibuffer and aborts to editor top
	level.  It is intended for use in error message pritning.

     display-error-noabort
	Prints a message in the minibufer and continues execution.  This
	function is intended for reporting non-fatal errors such
	as "User not accepting messages...".


     minibuffer-print
	Prints a message in the minibuffer.  The message is NOT printed
	during macro execution.  This function is intended for
	use by extensions which print messages in the normal process
	of their execution such as the line-count from ^X=.  For
	this function, as well as the others below, in multi-line
	minibuffer situations, an appropriate line is chosen based
	upon availability of empty lines and several other criteria.

     minibuffer-print-noclear
	Prints a message in the minibuffer but does not erase the
	previous contents.  The message is NOT printed during macro
	execution.  Output is appended to the last minibuffer line used.

     display-com-error
	Prints a message in the minibuffer and aborts to editor top
	level.  Its first argument is a Multics standard error code.
	It remaining arguments are character strings or symbols.
	See the section "Multics Error Table" below for the technique
	used to get error_table_ values into your program.

     display-com-error-noabort
	Prints a message in the minibuffer and continues execution.
	Its first argument is a Multics standard error code.

     minibuffer-clear
	Clears out the last minibuffer line that was written in, except
	during macro execution.  This function should be used to clear
	out minibuffers written in by minibuffer-print and
	minibuffer-print-noclear at the end of subsystem invocation.

     display-error-remark
	Identical to display-error-noabort, except that the particular
	minibuffer line on which this remark will be printed will be
	"targeted" to be the next ine overwritten for any minibuffer
	remark or output at all.  This function should be used for
	"transient" remarks (such as "Writing", "Modified", etc., which
	are desired to get off the screen as soon as possible.

			    V__a_r_i_a_b_l_e_s

     Many groups of Emacs commands need global variables to communicate 
amongst themselves and the functions they call.  A global variable is a Lisp
variable which is not the parameter of any particular function; its value may 
be accessed or set by any function.  Some of the global variables in Multics 
Emacs are highly user-visible, for example, "fill-column", which contains the 
column number of the fill column as set by ^XF, and used by the filling 
commands and fill mode.   Similarly, the character string which is the 
comment prefix is the binding of the global variable "comment-prefix".
Extensions will often need global variables to communicate among their parts.

     Normally, global variables in Lisp are accessed just line other 
variables, i.e., those which are parameters of functions or _p_r_o_g or _l_e_t 
variables (_l_e_t will be discussed later.).  For instance, a function which
wanted to set the fill column to 30. if it was over 40. now might contain
the code:

	(if (> fill-column 40.)(setq fill-column 30.))

     When a global variable is used in your program, say one named 
"my-global", the "declaration"

	(declare (special my-global))

must appear in the program before its first use, to tell the compiler about 
this "special" variable (which is the Lisp term for a global variable, 
incidentally).  The e-macros include file declares many of the provided 
global variables, you need not declare them.

     The global variable situation in Multics Emacs is complicated by the 
fact that editing activity is usually local to each buffer.
That is to say, if a set of global variables contains a set of values about
what is being edited, it usually pertains to what is going on in only one
editor buffer. If the user switches to a different buffer, and uses the same 
editor facility, we do not want to use or change the values of those global 
variables which pertained to activity in the other buffer.  At first, this 
would seem to make global variables unusable, because all functions would 
have to keep track of what buffer they are talking about before using any 
global variables, and maintaining several sets of them thereby.
Fortunately, it is a lot easier than that.  The buffer-switcher in Multics 
Emacs is willing to save and restore values of global variables as buffers 
are switched if you tell it what variables you want so saved and restored, when
the buffer you are operating in is exited and re-entered, respectively.  Such
a variable is called a _p_e_r-_b_u_f_f_e_r _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e, and the act of telling the 
buffer-switcher about it, thereby associating its current value with this 
buffer, is called _r_e_g_i_s_t_e_r_i_n_g it.  Once a variable has been registered in a 
given buffer, the functions which use it can assume that its value will be 
what it last was in that buffer whenever the editor enters that buffer.
Another term for a per-buffer variable is a _l_o_c_a_l _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e.
The following two primitives exist for registering local variables; there are 
no primitives for setting or retrieving their values, because the whole point 
of this mechanism is to allow them to be accessed as normal Lisp variables.

     register-local-variable
	Called with one argument, the symbol whose name is the name of the 
	local variable we wish to register.  Registers it in the current 
	buffer, if not already registered here.  If not already registered 
	here, the variable initially inherits its "global value";  if 
	registered, its value is left alone.  If it has no global value,
	it acquires the symbol "nil" as its value if this is its first 
	registration in this buffer.

     establish-local-var
	Just like register-local-variable, but takes a second argument,
	a default value to be initially assigned to the variable the first 
	time it is registered in this buffer, if it has no global value.

     The global value of a per-buffer-variable is the value it has in buffers
in which it is not registered.  It is this value which is set if you set this
variable while in a buffer in which it is not registered.  A local variable 
"inherits" its global value when it is first registered in a given buffer.
For variables that have no global value (i.e., were never assigned one),
establish-local-var can be used to good effect to provide default 
initialization.

     Here are three function which maintain a "problem count" in this buffer.
The user says ESC-Xmonitor-problemsCR to start it up in a given buffer,
and then can say ^X-P to count a problem, and ^X-R to report how many 
"problems" he has so noted:

(defun monitor-problems ()			;command-level function
       (set-key '^XP 'note-a-problem)		;set the keys needed, only
       (set-key '^XR 'report-problems)		;in this buffer
       (establish-local-var 'problem-count 0))	;register the local var, 
					;initial value 0 here.

(defun note-a-problem ()			;executed on ^XP
      (setq problem-count (+ 1 problem-count)))	;Increment the variable.

(defun report-problems ()			;on ^XR
       (minibuffer-print "There have been " (decimal-rep problem-count)
		     " problems in this buffer."))

     By calling establish-local-var on the symbol "problem-count", the
programmer here has ensured that the problem-count's in each buffer
in which he counts problems will be maintained separately.

			P__r_o_v_i_d_e_d V__a_r_i_a_b_l_e_s

     The following per-buffer variables are automatically registered by the
editor.  Their values may be inspected or set in extension code.  The following
table gives their names and meanings:

buffer-modified-flag
     Contains t or nil, indicating that this buffer has or has not been
     modified since last read in or written.  Set automatically by the
     editor.  Modification of a buffer executed within the special form

	(without-modifying <form1><form2>...<formn>)

     will not set this flag.

read-only-flag
     Contains t or nil indicating whether or not this is read-only buffer.
     The editor does not set this flag, it is set only by extensions.
     An attempt to modify the text in this buffer will produce an error
     and a quit to editor command level if this flag is on, and the
     buffer-modified-flag flag is off (nil).  The buffer may be modified,
     however, successfully, by functions executed from within extension code
     within a "(without-modifying ...)".

fpathname
     The full Multics pathname associated with this buffer by the last file
     read or written into/out of it, or by find-file. It is nil if there is
     none.  Changing it from extension code will modify or "forget" the
     pathname as you set it.

der-wahrer-mark   (name subject to change, use macros instead)
     The mark associated with the user-visible mark that ^X^X etc. see.
     Will be nil if no mark ever set by the user in this buffer.  Do not set
     this variable, call set-the-mark (the ^@ function) to do so.

current-buffer-mode
     The major mode in effect in this buffer.  The value is a symbol.  To 
     claim that a major mode of your construction is in effect in a buffer,
     simply set this variable.

comment-column
     The comment column, as always, measured from 0.

comment-prefix
     The string, which may be a null string, which is the comment prefix.

tab-equivalent
     The amount of spaces that a tab is worth.  Initialized to 10., the Multics
     standard, this can be set either in code or by ESC-ESC to edit code
     from other operating systems.  The redisplay will obey this variable too,
     but not in two-window mode.

buffer-minor-modes
     A Lisp list (to be explained) of symbols representing the minor modes
     in effect in this buffer.

			L__a_r_g_e S__c_a_l_e O__u_t_p_u_t

    Output of multi-line information, or information longer than about 60
characters, should not be done via display-error, which prints in the 
minibuffer area, but via the _l_o_c_a_l-_d_i_s_p_l_a_y, or _p_r_i_n_t_o_u_t facility. This is the 
facility with which buffer listings, global searches, apropos, and other 
familiar commands display their output.  On display terminals, it displays 
lines at the top of the screen, asking for "MORE?" as each screen fills up,
and pausing for the next Emacs command at the end of the display, and
restoring the screen.  On printing terminals, the data is simply printed
line by line, with no "MORE?" processing or pausing at the end.
The local display facility is an integral part of the Multics Emacs
redisplay.

     There are three common functions used in generating local displays:

init-local-displays
     is called with no arguments to start a local display.  It basically
     sets up the necessary redisplay mechanism, initializing it to the top
     of the screen.

local-display-generator
     This function is called with a string, whose last character must be a 
     newline, and displays it as the next line (or lines, if continuation lines
     are required) of local output.  If you do not have a newline at the end
     of your string, calling local-display-generator-nnl instead will provide
     one automatically.  There must be no embedded newlines in strings for
     local output.  A null string causes an empty line.

end-local-displays
     Finishes a local display, restoring the screen.  Causes
     the next redisplay to be suppressed, so the local display remains visible
     on the screen.

     The sequence of calls

	(init-local-displays)
	(local-display-generator(-nnl) ...)    ;perhaps many times
	(end-local-displays)

     correctly produces a local display.

     Often, the best way to generate a well-formatted local display is to set
up a temporary buffer (see "Manipulating Buffers" below), build some text in
it, and display its content, in part or in whole, as a local display.  Three
functions are provided to facilitate this:

local-display-current-line
     Does a local-display-generator on the current editor line in this buffer.

display-buffer-as-printout
     Does an init-local-displays, and displays all lines of the current
     buffer as local output.  It does NOT do an end-local-displays; you have to
     do that yourself, hopefully _a_f_t_e_r you have gotten out of your
     temporary buffer and cleaned up whatever else you had to.

view-region-as-lines
     Displays the entire point-to-user-visible-mark as local display,
     making all the necessary calls including end-local-displays.

     While in a function which has a local display in progress, you must never
call the redisplay (see "Calling the Redisplay" below), or call
minibuf-response or any other function which will cause redisplay, for that
will instantaneously restore the screen contents to the windows on display,
obliterating the local display in progress.

     The following function locally displays all lines in the buffer
that contain the string "defun":

(defun look-for-defuns ()			;use ESC-x look-for-defunsCR
       (save-excursion			;remember where we are.
	(go-to-beginning-of-buffer)
	(init-local-displays)		;set up for printout.
	(do-forever			;loop the buffer
	  (if (forward-search-in-line "defun")	;look for "defun"
	      (local-display-current-line))	;cause printout of it
	  (if (lastlinep)(stop-doing))	;check for EOB.
	  (next-line)))			;Go to start of next line.
       (end-local-displays))			;wait for user, and next
					;command.

		         M__a_n_i_p_u_l_a_t_i_n_g B__u_f_f_e_r_s

     The easiest way to do string processing in the editor environment, i.e.,
monkeying around with strings, catenating, searching, etc., is often to use
the primitives of the editor itself, which is, after all, a string-processing
language.  To do this, temporary buffers are necessary.  To create a buffer,
you should use the primitive "go-to-or-create-buffer", which is what
^XB uses, which goes to a buffer associated with the symbol you give it
as an argument.  We will discuss how to make it temporary shortly.

     Lisp symbols are funny things;  it was stated before that symbols are
kept in a registry.  This is true for most symbols: this registry is called
the _o_b_a_r_r_a_y, and there is only one symbol of any given name in it.
A symbol registered in the obarray is said to be _i_n_t_e_r_n_e_d.  There can
only be one interned symbol named "joe", but it is possible to create
many uninterned symbols named "joe".  If you refer to a symbol named "joe"
in a program, however, by saying "'joe", you will always be getting the
interned one.

     A major feature of symbols in Lisp is that they can be given _p_r_o_p_e_r_t_i_e_s,
arbitrary user-defined attributes.  These attributes are catalogued "in" the
symbol via _i_n_d_i_c_a_t_o_r_s, symbols which indicate what property we want.
The Lisp functions "putprop" and "get" store and retrieve properties.

	(putprop 'Fred 'blue 'eyes)	;Gives the interned symbol named "Fred"
				;an "eyes" property of "blue".

	(get 'Fred 'eyes)		;retrieves the property under the 
				;indicator "eyes", and thus returns
				;the interned symbol "blue".

     In Multics Emacs, symbols are used (among other things) to represent 
buffers.  All of the information associated with a buffer is catalogued as
properties of some symbol whose name is the name of the buffer.
Thus, it is possible to have two buffers of the same name, which would imply
that the of the symbols representing them, only one is interned. ^XB
always uses the interned symbol of the name given; that is why you can ^XB back
to an existent buffer instead of creating a new one each time.

     To create a temporary buffer, we must first create an uninterned symbol,
to make sure that we are not going to switch to a buffer that is already real.
To do this, we give a string to be used in naming the symbol to the
Lisp cliche

	(maknam (explodec  "A string"))

The explodec blows the string apart into a Lisp list of characters, the
maknam builds a symbol out of it.  The value of this form is the new symbol.
We can then go to a (guaranteed) new buffer of that name, i.e.,

	(go-to-or-create-buffer (maknam (explodec "A string")))

and the global variable "current-buffer" will have that symbol as its value.
A _t_e_m_p_o_r_a_r_y _b_u_f_f_e_r is one that is destroyed automatically by the editor upon 
switching out of it.  To  make a buffer temporary, all we have to do is give 
the symbol which represents it (the "buffer symbol") a "temporary-buffer" 
property of the symbol "t".  This can be done by the Lisp form

	(putprop current-buffer t 'temporary-buffer)

(The variable "t" is always bound to the symbol "t").  Once this has been 
done, we must be careful not to switch out of this buffer until we are done 
with it.  If our code involves manipulating many buffers, some of them 
temporary, we must give the temporary buffers their temporary-buffer 
properties at the end of our manipulations.

     When a new buffer is created, it contains one line, which consists of 
only a linefeed.  There are no "truly empty" buffers in Multics Emacs.
The predicate empty-buffer-p may be applied to a buffer symbol to
determine if that buffer is in this state.
When buffers are switched, all information related to the old buffer is stored
as properties of the buffer symbol: this includes not only the local 
variables registered in that buffer, but the location of "point", the 
user-visible (and all other) marks, etc.  Thus, when buffers are switched 
back and forth (as can be seen while editing), the cursor retains its 
position in each buffer, although the redisplay might choose to display a 
screen differently after visiting another buffer and coming back.

     There are some applications which require making a non-temporary 
buffer, putting some text in it, and going back there on occasion.  For this 
reason, we might want to go into a non-temporary buffer of an interned buffer 
symbol, as such:

	(go-to-or-create-buffer 'name-and-address-buffer)

or perhaps keep a global (_n_o_t per-buffer) variable which we set once to an 
uninterned symbol as such:

	(setq name-and-address-keep-track
		  (maknam (explodec "Name and Address Buffer")))

and switch into it by saying

	(go-to-or-create-buffer name-and-address-keep-track)


     The function "buffer-kill" may be called with a buffer symbol to destroy
a buffer.  The function "destroy-contents-of-buffer" (no arguments) may be 
called to reduce the current buffer to a single "empty" line.

     The following two variables are relevant to buffer manipulation:

current-buffer
     The value of this variable is the buffer symbol of the current buffer.  
     Do not change it, or incorrect operation will result.  Use 
     go-to-or-create-buffer.

previous-buffer
     The value of this variable is the buffer symbol of the last buffer, 
     which will be returned to when ^XB-CR is typed.  It is acceptable to setq
     this variable.  


     go-to-or-create-buffer will accept a buffer-name of "" as meaning
go to that previous buffer.

     The special form save-excursion-buffer is invaluable when writing 
functions that switch buffers.  It provides for remembering which buffer you 
were in, and switching back to it when you are done.  It also saves and 
restores the state of "previous-buffer".  save-excursion-buffer is like 
save-excursion, it executes its contained forms while pushing the 
buffer-state of the editor  on an internal stack, and returns the value of 
the last form within it.

     The following program when invoked after typing somebody's name (say we
hook it up to a key) and follows it with his title in parentheses.  We assume
the file >udd>Washington>States>personnel_data looks like this:

Rasputin, G. E. =Chief Lecher
Nietzsche, F. =Antichrist
Mouse, M. =Optimist
Eisenhower, D. D. =Golfer

(defun insert-person-title ()
       (let ((name (save-excursion			;save guy's point
		(skip-back-whitespace)		;get to end of word
		(with-mark m			;m = end of word

     This function operates by picking out the name you just typed by skipping
back over whitespace, and picking up all between there and the start of the 
previous (current) word.  It then inserts, between parentheses, the portion of
that line of the data file which contains the sought name at its front after 
the equals sign.  The buffer name-position-records is read into once, and
contains the data file thereafter.

     The initial save-excursion remembers the user's point location while the
word is collected:  The save-excursion-buffer remembers what buffer and where
in it, all its modes, local variables, etc., while we operate in the data 
file buffer.

     The function _c_a_t_e_n_a_t_e is an extremely valuable one in the context of 
Multics Emacs; it takes any number of strings (or symbols, whose print-name 
will be used), builds a string out of catenating them first-to-last, and 
returns it.

     The Multics Emacs redisplay is a large and powerful screen-management
system which functions completely automatically.  Its function, in simple 
terms, is to decide what lines of the current buffer should be shown on the
screen, determine how to modify the current screen to show the contents of 
those lines, and update the screen in an optimal manner.  It is called
by the editor whenever there is no more input available.  It is very simple
to call.  It takes no arguments, i.e., one just says

	(redisplay)

     The redisplay does not know or care by what means the buffer was 
modified;  if you delete several words with ESC-D, ^D, or ^W, it is all the 
same to the redisplay, and it will act similarly in updating the screen.

     Normally, the extension writer need not be concerned at all about the 
redisplay.  It is a major feature of Multics Emacs that only the total effect 
of a complex manipulation is displayed, not every small operation that the 
manipulation used to achieve its effect.

     There are some situations, however, where it is advantageous to call the 
redisplay explicitly from extension code.  One example might be a function 
which takes a tremendous amount of compute time and might wish to update the
screen every-so-often as it finishes some major section.  Note that you do not
tell the redisplay what do display or how to display it; it will display some
excerpt of the current buffer which is guaranteed to contain the current line,
and show the cursor where the current point is.  If you call it during a 
buffer excursion, i.e., while in some special buffer in a function, it will 
thus display that buffer about its "point", and as soon as that function
returns to editor command level, the screen will be overwritten with the 
original buffer's lines.  Thus, calling redisplay is _n_o_t to be considered a 
substitute for local displays (see above).

     The most common need for calling redisplay is in functions that add 
text (or change text) on a line, and move to another line.  For example, the 
"electric semicolon" of electric PL/I mode, which adds a semicolon to the 
current line and moves to the next.  On a printing terminal, the user would 
never see the semicolon unless special action were taken.  The text in the 
buffer would indeed be right, but by time the next redisplay occurred (the 
electric semicolon command returned) the editor would be off that line, and 
thus would display the next line, where the electric semicolon command left 
it.  While this is correct, the user looking at his type-in would, with some 
validity, complain that "all the semicolons seem to be missing".  Thus, the 
electric PL/I semicolon command calls the redisplay immediately after it 
executes "(insert-string ";")".

     The following divertissement is a function for a "card-numbering FORTRAN 
mode", which when invoked (perhaps hook it up to CR) puts a sequence number 
in column 72 (71 from 0) and goes to column 7 of the next line.

     It must call the redisplay, such that on a printing terminal, the card 
numbers get shown.

(defun fortran-next-line ()
       (whitespace-to-hpos 71.)		;go to col 72.
       (insert-string (decimal-rep cardno))	;cardno is a local buffer var
       (setq cardno (+ 1 cardno))		;up the next card number
       (redisplay)				;let printing user see.
       (new-line)				;get to next line
       (whitespace-to-hpos 6.))		;6 rel = card col 7.

     The Multics Emacs environment provides a powerful facility for utilizing 
the sophisticated 68/80 processor instructions for scanning for characters in 
or not in a particular set of characters.  These operations correspond to the 
PL/I "search" and "verify" builtins.  It is using these facilities that the 
word commands operate.

     A set of characters is represented by a "charscan table", a compound 
Lisp object occupying about 200 words of storage (i.e., they are not for 
free).   One can get a charscan table by giving a set of characters, as a 
string, to the function charscan-table.  It returns a charscan table 
representing that set of characters:

	(setq number-verify-table (charscan-table "0123456789+-"))

     Given such a table, there are  a set of functions which can be called to 
utilize it to search for characters in or out of that set, backward, forward,
whole buffer or only one line.  All the following functions take one argument,
a charscan table representing a set of characters we will call S.  They 
return nil (falsity) if they hit the end of the buffer or line (as 
appropriate) without finding what they are looking for.  If they succeed, they
move point.  If they fail, they don't move point:

search-for-first-charset-line
     Scans current line forward from point.  Success is stopping to the
     left of a character in S.

search-for-first-not-charset-line
     Same as above, but success is stopping to the left of a character _n_o_t
     in S.

search-back-first-charset-line
     Scans current line backward from point.  Success is stopping to the right
     of a character in S.

search-back-first-not-charset-line
     Same as search-back-first-charset-line, but success is stopping to the
     right of  a character _n_o_t in S.

search-charset-forward
     Scans the buffer from point to the end of the buffer.  Success is 
     stopping to the left of a character in S.

search-charset-backward
     Scans the buffer backward from point to the beginning of the buffer.
     Success is stopping to the right of a character in S.

search-not-charset-forward
     Scans the buffer forward from point to the end.  Success is stopping
     to the left of a character not in S.

search-not-charset-backward
     Scans the buffer backward from point to the beginning of the buffer.
     Success is stopping to the right of a character not in S.



     The following function finds the first non-numeric character on the line
it is invoked on:

(defun find-first-non-numeric ()
       (establish-local-var numscan-table nil)	;make sure var exists
       (if (not numscan-table)		;if nil, i.e., not init yet,
	 (setq numscan-table (charscan-table "0123456789")))
       (go-to-beginning-of-line)
       (if (not (search-for-first-not-charset-line numscan-table))
	 (minibuffer-print "Line is O.K.!")))	;failure is all is in charset

     The Multics Emacs option mechanism provides for user-settable variables
in the Lisp environment.  The only difference between an "option" and any 
other global Lisp variable in the editor (basic or extended) is that the 
options are listed at the user-visible level by ESC-Xopt listCR, and can be 
set or interrogated via the "opt" command.  The option mechanism also 
provides for checking that numeric variables stay numeric, and those variables
that are restricted to "t" or "nil" as values stay restricted to those values.

     Thus, options may control per-buffer or truly global variables; the 
option mechanism does not care about or impose restraints upon the dynamic 
scope of the variables managed by it.  The option mechanism also provides for 
a default global value of variables it manages.

     A global variable is "registered" with the option mechanism by invoking 
the function "register-option" upon the Lisp symbol which represents (has the 
name of) that variable, and its default global value.  If that value is a 
number, the option mechanism will restrict the variable's value to numbers; 
if it is one of t or nil, the option mechanism  will restrict its values to t 
or nil (which the user indicates as "on" or "off").

     The choice of whether a variable should be made an official "option" or 
not depends upon whether or not you want the user to see it when an "opt 
list" is done, and whether finer control than that provided by the option
mechanism over the values assigned to it is necessary.  It is acceptable to 
register an option the first time some code is executed; only then will it 
appear in the option list.  It is usual to have forms invoking 
"register-option" at "top-level" in a file full of code, i.e., outside of any 
function.  Such code is executed when the code is brought into the editor 
environment.

     The following code registers an option describing default paragraph 
indentation, and shows a function that creates a new paragraph (which should 
probably be hooked up to a key).  Note that like all Lisp global variables,
options must be declared "special" for the Lisp  compiler (see "compilation" 
below):

(declare (special paragraph-indentation))		;for compiler.

(register-option 'paragraph-indentation 10.)		;default is ten.

(defun new-paragraph ()
       (new-line)					;two new-lines
       (new-line)
       (whitespace-to-hpos paragraph-indentation))	;tab out.

     By issuing the command

     ESC-X opt paragraph-indentation 5 CR

the user can set the amount of indentation inserted by "new-paragraph" to 5.

      One of the large benefits of Lisp is that all of the functions and 
variables in the environment are accessible to all functions running in it.
At times, this can be a problem, as well.   When adding your own extensions 
to the editor environment, there is nothing to prevent you from choosing a 
name for one of your functions which happens to be the name of some internal
(or user-visible) function in Multics Emacs.  Occasionally, there may be reason
to do this deliberately , e.g., write your own version of "next-line" that
did something highly special.  This is dangerous, and not recommended.

     In the general case, you want to make sure that none of your functions 
or variables will conflict with those of the editor.  The best way to do this 
is to choose some set of names that cannot possibly conflict.  Two sure-fire 
ways to achieve this are to use capital letters anywhere (such as initial 
capitals) or using underscores in your names.  No  Emacs or Lisp system 
functions have leading capitals or trailing underscores.  There are a few
Lisp system functions with embedded underscores, but other than make_atom, it 
will not hurt you if you accidentally redefine them.  The Lisp compiler will 
also warn you if you attempt to redefine a system function.  No functions in 
Multics Emacs contain underscores in their names.

     Another more reasonable way to avoid name scope conflicts is to prefix all
of your names in a given package with some prefix indicative of the facility
that you are trying to implement.  For instance, if you are implementing a 
SNOBOL edit mode, you might name your functions 
"snobol-mode-find-match-string", "snobol-mode-get-branch-target", etc.  The 
same holds true for global variable names.

     You can also be reasonably certain that names constructed on the fly
(see "Program Development" below) with some degree of ludicrosity in their 
names (e.g., "find-third-foo", "Johns-special-tsplp-hack", etc.) will not 
conflict.

     One can test for a name being known in the Emacs environment via the 
predicate "internedp" (not installed as of 8/16), which tests whether or not 
a symbol with the given name is interned on the obarray.  You must give it a 
string.  It will return t or nil for interned or not.  From Emacs command 
level,

	ESC-ESC internedp "test-string"CR

will print out 

	Value: t

or

	Value: nil

as appropriate.  This test is not a foolproof method, though, because some
name which is not used now may be used later, as new versions of Multics
Emacs are developed.  The rules given above will remain valid for all time.


			      M__o_d_e_s

     The major and minor mode mechanism of Multics Emacs, as it exists today,
is little more than a way for the user to switch in and out large sets of 
key-bindings and column settings, and know about it via the mode line.

     The differentiation between major modes and minor modes is vague.  The 
current convention holds that a major mode involves a large body of optional 
code (e.g., PL/I mode), sets up for a editing code written in a particular 
language, or sets up a buffer for some highly specialized task where very 
common keys (e.g., CR) do non-obvious things (e.g., the Message mode buffers 
of the Emacs message facility).  Minor modes generally involve the say that 
whitespace or delimiters are interpreted, e.g., fill mode and speedtype mode.

     The current convention on major modes is that the major mode is set up by
a user-visible function called "XXX-mode", where XXX is the name of the mode.
This "mode function"  establishes key-bindings (using set-key) as necessary, 
and sets columns (e.g., fill-column, comment-column) and prefixes as 
necessary.   The mode function establishes the mode by setting the 
per-buffer-variable "current-buffer-mode" to a _s_y_m_b_o_l whose name is 
indicative of the mode.  The name of the symbol will appear in the mode line 
when the redisplay is invoked while in this buffer.  The following function
sets up a major mode for editing FORTRAN programs:

(defun fortran-mode ()				;the mode function
       (setq current-buffer-mode 'FORTRAN)		;symbol for mode
       (setq fill-column 70.)				;set columns
       (setq fill-prefix "      ")			;six spaces on CR
       (set-key 'CR 'fortran-new-line)			;set up CR key
       (setq comment-column 1)
       (setq comment-prefix "C "))			;that begins cmts.
       
The function fortran-new-line is assumed to be one which does something 
appropriate, such as numbering cards.  Note that the use of the function 
set-key implies that this key binding (of the carriage-return key) is
local to this buffer, and will be reverted when this buffer is exited.

     Minor modes are less straightforward.  Minor modes such as speedtype
and fill mode have different actions associated with the keys they affect
(for instance, all the "punctuation" keys), and the minor modes have to have
detailed and specialized interaction between themselves.  There is no way to
generalize the interactions between the minor modes; no completely adequate
solution to this problem has been developed.

     Minor modes are asserted and turned off in a given buffer by calling the
functions "assert-minor-mode" and "negate-minor-mode" while in that buffer, 
with an interned symbol which identifies that mode (and appears in the mode 
line).  There is a per-buffer variable called buffer-minor-modes which has a
value a Lisp list of all the symbols identifying the   minor modes in effect 
in this buffer.  The Lisp predicate "memq" can be used to test whether a given
interned symbol is a member of a list, and thus, whether a given minor mode 
is in effect n the current buffer:

     (memq 'fill buffer-minor-modes)

will return the symbol "t" (truth to _i_f) if fill mode is in effect in this 
buffer, otherwise it will return "nil" (false).  Functions implementing the
actions of keys in minor modes should check in this way to see what other 
minor modes are in effect, and what they ought do in that case.  This is 
admittedly not an easy design problem.

     The global variable fill-mode-delimiters is bound to a Lisp list of keys 
that act as punctuation in many minor modes.  By use of the Lisp function
"mapc", all punctuation can be set to trigger a given action.  "mapc" takes
two arguments, a function, and a Lisp list: the function will be called upon 
each element of the list:

(defun no-punc-mode-word-on-a-line-mode-on ()		;mode function
     (mapc 'word-on-a-line-setter fill-mode-delimiters)	;set up keys
     (assert-minor-mode 'word-on-a-line))		;get in mode line

(defun word-on-a-line-setter (key)			;key is the key
       (set-key key 'word-on-a-line-responder))		;set these keys

(defun word-on-a-line-responder ()			;key function
       (delete-white-sides)				;get rid of whitesp
       (self-insert)			;insert the typed character
       (new-line))				;start a new line.

This set of functions (very crudely) establishes a minor mode in which
each word goes on a separate line as it is typed.

     It is often very useful to make decisions based upon the
identity of the character to the right (or left) of the current point.  The
Multics Emacs environment provides several special forms and functions for
facilitating this efficiently.  All of these functions and forms accept
either of two ways of describing characters: either a single-character string
(e.g., "."), or a symbol whose name is that character (e.g., 'a, as it would 
appear in a program).  We will call the first kind the "string form", and the
second kind "character objects".

     The function "curchar", of no arguments, returns the character to the
right of the current point as a character object (this is done for reasons of 
storage efficiency: character objects are unique, while strings require 
allocation).  You can test for two character objects being the same unique 
object (or any two objects, in general) via the Lisp predicate "eq":

(if (eq (curchar) 'a)
    (display-error "We are looking at an ""a""."))

Note that we could have also done this with the "looking-at" predicate 
described above, but for single characters, looking-at is a lot less efficent,
in both time and storage.

     Please note very carefully that you cannot use _e_q to test if two strings 
have the same characters in them;  Lisp strings are _n_o_t uniquized in the same 
way that symbols are uniquized via the obarray.

     In order to facilitate the use of "messy" characters (tabs, linefeeds,
spaces, quotes, etc.) in this way, the Emacs environment provides several
global variables with values of the character objects for these "messy" 
characters:

ESC		ASCII ESC, Ascii 033.
CRET		ASCII Carriage return (Ascii 015)
NL		ASCII Newline (linefeed), Ascii 012.
SPACE		ASCII blank, Ascii 040.
TAB		ASCII tab, Ascii 011.
BACKSPACE		ASCII backspace, Ascii 010.
DOUBLEQUOTE	", Ascii 042.
SLASH		/, Ascii 057, hard to type in Lisp code.

Note that (eq (curchar) NL) is equivalent to (eolp).

     There is a special form to test if the current (to the right of point) 
character is a given character: it is called if-at:

(if-at "&" (display-error "You can't have an ampersand here!"))

Its syntax is the same as _i_f, i.e., it has one or none or many "then" clauses 
and "else" clauses, separated by the keyword "else" if there are any "else" 
clauses.  However, instead of a predicate, _i_f-__a_t takes either a 
single-character string or a character object to be compared against the
current character.  If the current (to right of point) character is that 
character, the _t_h_e_n forms are evaluated, etc.  _i_f-__a_t will convert the
character string to a character object at Lisp compile time, if necessary.
The specification of the character must be a form which evaluates to
the character of interest (e.g., "a", 'a, variable-bound-to-an-a):

(if-at TAB (delete-char)
	 (whitespace-to-hpos next-field))	;tab to next field.

     The exact effect (and actual implementation) of _i_f-__a_t is as though
it were a shorthand for

	(if (eq (curchar) ....) ..... ..... ..... )

     There is similarly a function called "lefthand-char", which is like
_c_u_r_c_h_a_r except that it returns the character to the _l_e_f_t of the current 
point; if the current point is at the beginning of the buffer, it returns
a character object for a newline (which is almost always what you want).
Similarly, there is an "if-back-at" special form, whose syntax and semantics
are identical to "if-at", except that it deals with the character to the
_l_e_f_t of the current point.

     Ther are two special forms for dispatching on the current (lefthand or 
righthand) character.  They are called dispatch-on-current-char
and dispatch-on-lefthand-char, and dispatch upon the character to the
_r_i_g_h_t and the _l_e_f_t of the current point respectively:

(declare (special parentable))			;global var.
(setq parentable nil)		;done when code is loaded into editor

(defun count-parens-in-buffer ()
       (if (not parentable)				;if not initialized
	 (setq parentable (charscan-table "()")))	;init it.
       (let ((leftcount 0)(rightcount 0))		;init the counts.
	  (save-excursion				;be nice
	   (go-to-beginning-of-buffer)
	   (do-forever
	    (if (not (search-charset-forward parentable)) ; look for ( or ).
	        (stop-doing))			;exit the do.
	    (dispatch-on-current-char			;see which.
	     ( "("	(setq leftcount (+ 1 leftcount)))
	     ( ")"	(setq rightcount (+ 1 rightcount))))))
	 (minibuffer-print (decimal-rep leftcount) " opens, "
		         (decimal-rep rightcount) "closes.")))

The general syntax of dispatch-on-current-char and dispatch-on-lefthand-char
is as follows:

(dispatch-on-current-char
  (CH1		<CH1-form1>
		<CH1-form2>
		...........
		<CH1-formn>)
  (CH2		<CH2-form1>
		<CH2-form2>
		...........
		<CH2-formn2>)
...............................
  (CHk		<CHk-form1>
		<CHk-form2>
		...........
		<CHk-formnk>)
  (else		<else-form1>
		<else-form2>
		............
		<else-formn>))
		
     The CHi's can be any form which evaluates to a single-character string 
or to a character object. When the current character (left or right as 
appropriate) matches a CHi, all of the <CHi-form>'s in that clause are
evaluated sequentially, and the value of the last returned as the value
of the dispatch-on-current-char (nil is returned if there are no 
<CHi-form>'s).  If no CHi's match, the else clause is evaluated as though it
were a matching clause.  The else clause is optional; if omitted, and no
CHi matches, nil is returned.

     The editor itself provides many powerful tools for developing extension
code and testing it while editing it.  The following is a typical scenario
in the development of an extension:

     The user decides to write an extension.  He sits down and thinks about 
it, and decides to code it.  He enters Multics Emacs.  He does a
^X^Fshaver.lispCR, to go into a new buffer with a proper file name
and select Lisp major mode (assuming that he has, as all sophisticated users 
should, opt for find-file-set-modes "on").  He should then type the form

	(%include e-macros)

at the top of his file; this will be necessary to compile it (see 
"Compilation" below), or to use the "loadit" command, as we will describe.
The file e-macros.incl.lisp should be in the translator search rules for
your process.  A good way to to do this is put a link to it in the directory 
in which you do Emacs extension development; the file is found in the same
directory as the editor.  Now we begin to type in a function:

(%include e-macros)

(defun shave-line ()
      (go-to-beginning-of-line)

At this point, to type the next line, lining it up with the last
Lisp form, we use the indent-to-lisp command, which is on ESC-CR
on Lisp mode, and the next form will automatically indent properly:

      (delete-white-space)

(We deliberately gave the wrong name here).  When typing in Lisp in general,
ESC-CR (in Lisp mode) will indent you on the next line the right amount.

      (go-to-end-of-line)
      (delete-white-space)

Now we are looking at the buffer with the code for "shave-line" in front of
us.  We wish to try it.  The best way to do this is to load the code in the
buffer into the editor.  ESC-^Z in Lisp mode does this.  No sooner do we do
this then we get the message:

	Unbalanced parentheses.

What this means is that there were not enough close parentheses somewhere:
Emacs could not find the boundaries of the Lisp form.  Now we fix the program
problem.  We are on the last line, so we just type the close paren:

      (delete-white-space))

Now we do the ESC-^Z again.  It works, the cursor returns to the function we
are trying to edit.  Now to see if it works, we invoke it from Lisp:

	ESC-ESC shave-line CR

ESC-ESC puts parens around what you type, evaluates it, and types out the 
Lisp value so returned.  However, we find the message

       lisp: undefined function: delete-white-space

printed in the minibuffer, with the terminal bell rung.  In fact, this is the
case.  So we realize, that we must have the wrong function name.  We know it's
on a key, so we

     ESC-X apropos white CR

and learn about delete-white-sides.  Now we go to the first line that
has the bad function name, with ^P's, do an @ to clear the line out,
ESC-^I to line up to re-type the form, and

     (delete-white-sides)

We fix the other bad line, too.  Now again we type

     ESC-ESC shave-line CR

and to our surprise it says

     lisp: undefined function: delete-white-space

as though we hadn't changed anything.  Indeed, fixing it in the buffer is not 
good enough.  We must reload it into the editor environment, so we use
ESC-^Z again, after fixing the screen.  Now we try it again:

     ESC-ESC shave-line CR

and immediately our function on the screen changes appearance, all the 
whitespace on the ends of the last line of the function we edited disappears.
Indeed it works, but it has messed up its own face!  This is a problem with
editing what you are testing:  It must either be innocuous, i.e., do 
something harmless, or you must be prepared to reconstruct damage your
nascient function perpetrates, or switch to a test buffer before running it.

     So we fix our function, and we are done.  Wrong! It exists in an editor
buffer, and in the editor Lisp environment, but we must remember to write it 
out:

     ^X^S

will indeed write it out to shaver.lisp as we had set up for initially.  Now 
we have an operative Lisp program that we can use again.  If in a future 
invocation of the editor, we need to use it, we can type

     ESC-X loadfile <path>shaver.lisp CR

and get it into the environment.  There are two problems with this, however:

     1) Whoever loadfile's it will have to have e-macros.incl.lisp in his
	translator search rules

     2) The code will be executed interpretively by the Lisp interpreter in
	the Lisp subsystem;  Multics Emacs is compiled Lisp, and compiled
	Lisp runs up to 100 times fster than interpreted Lisp and has fewer
	problems.

The file shaver.lisp should be compiled.  Then, the compiled object segment 
can be loaded into the editor with

     ESC-Xloadfile <path>shaver

     Some other problems are of immediate interest to the extension writer.
It is possible to write loops that do not terminate, or that generate infinite
garbage.  This is par for the course.  If you invoke your command, and the 
cursor never leaves the minibuffer, and ^G seems to have no effect, you are 
in a loop.  Hit QUIT, and use the "pi" Multics command to reenter Emacs.
If you are really unfortunate, you will get

     lisp: (nointerrupt t) mode, cannot accept interrupt

in which case you were stuck in the process of generating infinite garbage.
In this case, you must release, and your editing session is lost.  If you are
more fortunate, you will get your screen back, with the cursor at the place
your buggy function left it.  Often, by looking at exactly where it left it,
you can get a good idea of what kind of thing was giving your program a hard 
time.

     If you get messages from Multics which tend to indicate that there is no 
more room in your process directory, you are probably generating an infinite
number of lines, i.e., an infinite buffer.  Again, if you are up to this, you
must be aware of this.

     Another thing that can happen is you might expose some bug, or what you
believe to be bug, in Multics Emacs, or worse yet, Multics Lisp.  If this
happens, please let us know via the trouble-report forwarding mechanism
described in emacs.info, describing what you encountered and why you think
it's a bug.

     It is also possible to destroy the editor environment by bad coding.
This is particularly true in running compiled code which was not checked out
interpretively (i.e., via ESC-^Z).  Storing into "nil" is one common way to do 
this.  If the entire editor seems broken, and the redisplay won't even show the
screen, this is what you have done. Quit and release and start all over again.

     There is a function called debug-e, callable as

     ESC-X debug-e CR

which will set "(*rset t)" mode and other  Lisp debugging aids, and unsnap all
"lisp links".  IT will also revert to native Maclisp QUIT/pi handling.  To use
this, however, you must be familiar with the debugging features of Multics
Maclisp.

     To get the value of a global variable to be printed out, say, 
fill-column, fool ESC-ESC into doing it by saying

     ESC-ESC progn fill-column CR

Be careful, for values typed out are in octal.

     Now there exists an entire Lisp code debugging facility within
Emacs over and above this; it is called LDEBUG, or Lisp Debug
mode.  It allows for the setting of breakpoints, dialogue with Lisp
within Emacs, tracing, and so forth.  See ldebug-mode.info,
or the appropriate part of CJ52, Emacs Extension Writer's Guide.

			   C__o_m_p_i_l_a_t_i_o_n

     All production Multics Lisp programs are compiled.  This results in a
tremendous performance improvement, both for the user and the system.  Compiled
Lisp programs are executed directly by the Multics processor; interpreted
programs are interpreted by the Lisp interpreter.  Multics Emacs is compiled 
Lisp.

    The Lisp compiler is a Multics program that can be invoked from command 
level.  It has the names lcp and lisp_compiler on it.  To compile a program 
named myfuns.lisp, you say

     lcp myfuns

to Multics, and you will get, if all goes well, an object program named 
"myfuns", which can be loadfile'd, in the working directory.

     The compiler diagnoses Lisp syntax errors.  It warns you of implied 
special variables (if you did not declare a variable special, and it is not
a local variable in the function in which it was referenced, there is a good 
chance you either made  mistake or a typo.  All global variables should be 
declared for this reason: e-macros declares the provided ones.)

     At the end of compilation, the compiler prints out the names of functions
referenced in the code but not defined in the file.  This is normal; however,
you should scan the list it prints out to see if any are ones that you 
thought you defined; if so, you have a problem.  Check also for ones that
are obvious typos for what you meant.

     It is possible to do extravagantly complex things with the compiler; 
especially, via the constructs known as L__i_s_p M__a_c_r_o_s (via which, incidentally, 
the E__m_a_c_s environment special forms are implemented) to construct your
own special forms.  We will not go into any of that here.  Consult other 
documents on Multics Maclisp.

     It is sometimes desireable, while editing a large extension program,
to load only one function, the one you are looking dead at on the screen,
into the editor environment.  The powerful function compile-function,
on ESC-^C in Lisp mode, will compile the function you are looking at
(whose start is found by ESC-^A from where you are now) out of a temporary
segment in the process directory, load the object segment, and display the
compiler diagnostics via local printout.  It should be used with care by
any except experienced Emacs extension coders.  Be careful, when using it,
to remember to write out your changes, and recompile your whole program,
because a program incrementally debugged in this mode gives the impression
that it is working properly when it is only doing so in the current editor
environment.

     One of the most attractive features of the Emacs environment is the
automatic documentation system (apropos, ESC-?), which provides customized
Emacs command documentation on request.  Documentation for supplied
commands is kept in a special file in the Emacs environment directory.
Extension writers may provide documentation for their own commands by
placing a string, which is that documentation, as the "documentation"
property of the symbol which is the command being documented.  For instance,
if the symbol "remove-every-other-word" has the "documentation" property
of

      "Removes every other word from the sentence in which the cursor appears."

this information will be displayed by ESC-? when used on some key which had
been set-key'ed to remove-every-other-word, or by

     ESC-X describe remove-every-other-word

     Documentation properties are assigned most conveniently via the
Lisp special form "defprop", whose general syntax is:

     (defprop SYMBOL WHAT PROPERTY)

which gives the symbol SYMBOL a PROPERTY property of WHAT.  "defprop"
is a special form because the actual symbols appearing in the form
are used, they are not variables, as in "(+ a b c)".  Thus,

     (defprop Joe Fred father)

indeed gives the symbol "Joe" a "father" property of "Fred".  
("defprop" is a special-form way of doing the same thing as the
"putprop" function, but it is a special form because is "arguments"
are NOT forms to be evaluated to produce symbols whose properties
are to be dealt with, but the symbols themselves).  To use
"defprop" to establish Emacs command documentation, place forms like

(defprop remove-every-other-word
	"Removes every other word from the current sentence.
Will not work on sentences ending in ""?"".  For indented
sentences, use $$remove-other-word-from-indented-sentences$.
$$$ is a very powerful, dangerous, command."
	documentation)

Note several things about the documentation string:

 1. It does not need to end in a newline, and may contain newlines.

 2. Quotes (") inside of it must be doubled.

 3. The string "$$$" will be replaced by the key being asked about
    (e.g., "ESC-^Z" or "ESC-X remove-every-other-word") at the time
    the documentation is displayed.

 4.  The keys used to invoke other commands may be referenced by stating two
     dollar signs, the name of the command, and one dollar sign.  Thus,
     $$go-to-end-of-line$ will appear as "^E" in most environments;  the point
     of this and the previous paragraph is to make documentation expansion
     independent of a user's key-bindings.

The entire documentation string will be "filled" (ESC-Q'ed) _a_f_t_e_r all
command-name substitutions are made;  thus, the placement of newlines in the
documentation string is basically ignored.  Two consecutive newlines, however,
will be preserved, and thus, lines may be set off for "examples", etc., by
surrounding them with blank lines.

     It is slightly more efficient, but clearly less readable, to place the
defprop's documenting a command _b_e_f_o_r_e the "defun" defining the command
itself.  The "defcom" facility may also be used to document commands;
See "Defining commands with defcom" below.

     Although buffers appear in windows on user request, and are switched
between automatically by the redisplay when the user switches windows with the
^X^O, ^X4, and so forth, there are times when extension writers may
want to take advantage of  multiple windows explicitly.  Good
examples in supplied code are RMAIL reply mode and comout (^X^E).

     Most of the extensions of interest are ones in which the extension
writer wants to place some information in a buffer, or else prepare
some buffer to have information placed in it (e.g., RMAIL reply)
and then display that information in a window.  Normally, all that
is required is to "go to" that buffer (e.g., with go-to-buffer or
go-to-or-create-buffer), and the redisplay will "find" the editor
in that buffer at the time of the next redisplay, and it will
replace the contents of the selected window on the screen.
We will call such commands "autophanic" (self-showing).  Examples
are ^XB (select-buffer), ^X^F (find-file), etc.

     However, there are commands that wish to set up buffers in some
_o_t_h_e_r window than the current window, usually for multi-window
operations such as mail reply, so as not to disturb the contents
of the current window.  We will call them "heterophanic" (other-showing).
The standard examples are dired-examine, mail reply, and comout (^X^E).
Note that all the examples given are sub-commands of larger,
autophanic commands.

     Heterophanic buffer behavior is provided by the function
find-buffer-in-window, whose purpose is mentioned in windows.info (CH27 Sec.
XVI).  It takes as an argument a buffer-symbol (Lisp symbol representing a
buffer).  That buffer will be created if it does not now exist, and will be
"gone to", as if go-to-buffer had been used.  If Emacs is in single-window
mode, the effect will be the same as that of go-to-or-create-buffer.  In
two-window mode, that buffer will be put on display in one window or some
other as follows:

    If it is already on display in some window, it will be left there.
    If it is _n_o_t, it will be put on display in some _o_t_h_e_r window,
       meaning the one in which the cursor is _n_o_t, and the cursor
       will move to that window, as if a ^X^O had been done.  The
       least-recently used window will be chosen.

     Thus, on printing terminals and in single-window mode, the effect
of find-buffer-in-window is indistinguishable from that of
go-to-or-create-buffer.  In multi-window mode, it is equivalent to
"go-to-or-create-buffer and show it someplace else on the screen."

     You must not use find-buffer-in-window to place a buffer on the
screen once you have already gone to it;  if you think of
find-buffer-in-window as a fancy kind of go-to-or-create-buffer you
will find no need for doing so. IF, however, you encounter this very
rare need (Emacs uses it only once!), how to do it will be
described below.

     It is an extension's responsibility to establish multiple windows if it
_n_e_e_d_s them; no current Emacs code _r_e_q_u_i_r_e_s multiple windows, although the
facilities mentioned above are more utile when already in it.

     Variables, predicates, and other functions to determine or
effect the window organization (number of windows present, etc.)
are presented below.

     Most extensions that place an auxiliary buffer on display via
find-buffer-in-window provide some command to return to the "main"
buffer (e.g., the RMAIL Incoming Message buffer, the buffer from which
^X^E was issued, etc.).  It is the case that if you entered a buffer
via find-buffer-in-window, you should probably return to the buffer
from whence you came via find-buffer-in-window as well; the effect of this
is to restore not only the original buffer, but the original window
as well. Thus, save-excursion-buffer _c_a_n_n_o_t be used effectively
to effect returns from trips into buffers entered via find-buffer-in-window;
an attempt to use save-excursion-buffer will result in both windows showing
the same buffer, as the "selected window" (i.e., the cursor-bearing window)
is now changed and a new buffer selection means a new buffer in that window.

     It is the intended standard that ^X^Q be used to exit auxiliary buffers
used by extensions to return to their "main buffer", and usually switch
windows as well, if the multiple-window strategy outlined above is used.

     Pop-up window mode is in essence making all commands heterophanic.
Commands or subcommands that are naturally heterophanic need not worry about
pop-up window mode, because find-buffer-in-window, takes the appropriate
action in either pop-up or non-pop-up mode.  However, if proper heterophanic
behavior under pop-up windows is desired, naturally autophanic commands and
subcommands must call a window-management primitive to obtain
heterophanic behavior in pop-up window mode.  The primitive
of interest is called select-buffer-window, which takes two arguments
a buffer-symbol, and a "key" which gives pop-up window management
some clue to what size window would be wanted if awindow had to be created.

     In non-pop-up window mode, select-buffer-window is equivalent to
go-to-or-create-buffer, and the key is ignored.  In pop-up mode, it is
equivalent to find-buffer-in-window, with the key suggesting the
new window size.

     The following values for the key argument to select-buffer-window
are accepted.  They specify the window size in pop-up mode if the
window does not exist already:

	any number		That many lines.
	'cursize			Make a choice based on
				the current number of lines in
				the buffer.
	nil			Choose some reasonable fraction
				of the screen.
	'cursize-not-empty		Same as nil if the buffer is empty
				but same as 'cursize if it's not>
				For example, ^X^F uses this, because
				you will type into a new buffer.
	'default-cursize		If this buffer has never been displayed
				before, make some decision based on the
				number of lines.  Otherwise, use
				what size was chosen last time..

     As we mentioned, find-buffer-in-window may not be used to place
the "current buffer" heterophanically.  If you attempt to do this, i.e.,

	(find-buffer-in-window current-buffer)

you will find it appearing in both the old and new windows, for the
window manager will find that you were in this buffer in the
current window (a truth) before you went to another one (you had
to go to another one, as per heterophanic behavior), and
will indicate that the current buffer is to be displayed in the old window
as well, for that was the last buffer you were in in that window.
To avoid this, use select-buffer-find-window (of two arguments,
the buffer and a key as for select-buffer-window) if heterophanic
display of the current buffer is needed, i.e.,

	(select-buffer-find-window current-buffer nil)

It is very rare that this is needed; it is very rare to go to a buffer
and then want to find-buffer-in-window it; in supplied Emacs, only
^X^E does this.

     As all things that would want to use these features are of necessity
moderately sophisticated, only an outline of an extension using them
is given here.  It is a typical sub-subsystem (e.g., dired) which
sets itself up in an autophanic buffer display, with specific
key bindings, etc., and has a heterophanic sub-display by which
it displays a "menu" in addition to the main display:

(defun unusual-mode ()			;Setup function for this
       ...........				;mode.
       (go-to-or-create-buffer (maknam (explodec "Unusual buffer")))
       (set-key 'ESC-^S 'unusual-mode-show-menu)
       (select-buffer-window current-buffer nil)
       (register-local-var 'unusual-mode-buffer-to-return-to)
      ...........)

 ............
(declare (special unusual-mode-buffer-to-return-to))   ;for compiler.
(defun unusual-mode-show menu ()
       (setq unusual-mode-buffer-to-return-to current-buffer)    ;save buff
       (find-buffer-in-window 'Unusual-Menu)	;Display menu
       (set-key 'r 'unusual-mode-select-item)	;Set key bindings
       (set-key '^X^Q 'unusual-mode-menu-return)
       (insert-string "Unusual menu delicacies")	;Fill it up
       ;; Will not actually be displayed until command finishes.
       .......
       (go-to-beginning-of-buffer)
       (setq current-buffer-mode 'Unusual/ Menu buffer-modified-flag nil
	   read-only-flag t)
       .........)

(defun unusual-mode-menu-return ()
       (find-buffer-in-window unusual-mode-buffer-to-return-to))
       ;;Return to calling buffer.
			 
     There are several more primitives the window-sensitive
extension writer should be aware of.  They deal with windows by "window
number".  The topmost window on the screen is window number 1; The
next one down, if any, is number 2, and so forth down (the minibuffer and
mode line do not count as windows in this consideration).  The concept
of selected-window (and selection of windows) is as in windows.info
(or CH27, Section XVI.)

   selected-window
	This _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e contains the number of the currently
	selected window.  Do _n_o_t attempt to setq it to select a window;
	Use select-window instead.

   nuwindows
	This _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e contains the number of windows on the
	screen; do _n_o_t attempt to setq it to create or delete
	windows; use delete-window and the ^X2 and ^X3 functions
	to do these things.

   select-window
	This _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n  (of one argument, a window number)
	does what ^X4 does (with an argument), i.e., selects that
	window.

   delete-window
	This _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n of one argument, a window number,
	removes that window from the screen, dividing up its space
	to adjacent windows.

   buffer-on-display-in-window
	This _p_r_e_d_i_c_a_t_e function of one argument, a buffer-symbol,
	and returns truth/falsity, truth if and only if the specified
	buffer is on display in some window currently on the screen.
	If used as a _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n, i.e., the value returned
	is inspected, it will be found to be the window number in which
	the specified buffer is on display (if it is _n_o_t on display, the
	symbol "nil", via which Lisp represents falsity, is returned).

   window-info
	This is a function of one argument, a window number, which
	returns information about that window.  The information
	is in the form of a piece of Lisp list structure, which may be
	decomposed by the Lisp list destructuring functions; assuming
	that "info" has the result of window-info, the following forms
	return the information as follows:

		(caar info) => The top line-number on the screen of the
			     window.  The topmost is #0.
		(cdar info) => The number of lines in the window.
		(caddr info) => The buffer-symbol of the buffer on
			      display in the window.
		(cadddr info) => A string duplicating the contents of the
			       "cursor line" of the window, including
			       its new-line character.    The cursor
			       line of a buffer is that line where the
			       cursor is (if it is in the selected
			       window) or would be if that window
			       became selected (e.g., ^XO).

   window-adjust-upper
	A function of two arguments, the first a window number, and
	the second a _s_i_g_n_e_d number of lines to move its
	upper divider-line _d_o_w_n (negative is up).

   window-adjust-lower
	Same as window-adjust-upper, but deals with lower divider line.

     There are several useful functions provided for the extension writer
to aid in providing search-type commands.  These functions prompt
for the search string, defaultify the search string, and announce
search failure in a standardized way which causes all Emacs search
commands to behave in a uniform fashion.  All supplied Emacs searches
use them.

     get-search-string
	Takes one argument, the prompt.  The prompt ought contain
	the word "search" somehwere, so that the user might know
	that a search is being prompted for.  get-search-string will
	prompt the user for a search string, which the user must
	terminate with a CR, and return it as a string.
	If the user gives a null string, the last search string
	will be used and echoed.  The last search string will be set
	to the returned string for the next defaulting.

     search-failure-annunciator
	Causes the "Search Fails." message to appear in the minibuffer,
	and a command-quit (^G) to be performed.  Note that this will
	abort any keyboard macro collection or execution in progress.

     The writer of a search-type command should provide two interfaces,
a "command", which deals in calling the above two primitives, and a
"search primitive", also called by the "command".  The search primitive
should return t (truth) if the search succeeds, leaving "point"
at the proper place as the search defines.  If the search fails,
the primitive must return nil (falsity), and leave point where it
was when the primitive was invoked.

     Here is a simple implementation of a "wraparound search", like
the default search in the QEDX editor.  It first looks from point to
the end of the buffer for the search string, and if that fails, it goes
to the top and searches again.  It is not optimal because the it need not
scan farther than the original point when starting from the top.  Using
"point>markp" and searching a line at a time would be very expensive,
due to point>markp's expense.  Searching a line at a time using
forward-search-in-line an mark-on-current-linep would be acceptable, but
more complex than this example need be.  For a search which is probably
going to be used only as a user interface (i.e., not internally), this
implementation is probably adequately efficient.

     Here is the internal primitive for wraparound search:

     (defun wraparound-search-primitive (string)
	  (with-mark m			;Remember starting point
	      (if (forward-search string)	;Look to end of buffer
		t			;Return truth.
		else
		(go-to-beginning-of-buffer)
		(if (forward-search string)	;Look from top.
		    t
		    else
		    (go-to-mark m)		;Return to orig. place.
		    nil)))))		;Return falsity
	      ;; with-mark and this function, will
	      ;; return the value of the outer "if".

     Now here is the command for calling the primitive:

     (defun wraparound-search ()
	  (if (not (wraparound-search-primitive
		    (get-search-string "Wraparound Search: ")))
	      (search-failure-annunciator)))

     wraparound-search is the command to which some key should be bound
if this type of search is to be made available from the keyboard.

     There is a common need in extensions, especially those like DIRED,
which manipulate the Multics Environment, to call Multics commands,
or, more generally, execute Multics command lines.

     The issue of calling PL/I-coded subroutines is a separable one.  The
Lisp defpl1 facility is used for that, and we have not documented this yet.
See extant extensions (and e_defpl1_.lisp) for examples and usage until then.

     There are two primitives provided for executing Multics command lines.
Multics command lines are strings submitted to cu_$cp for execution.
This is the Multics agency to which the "e" requests of EDM and QEDX,
the ".." requests of read_mail, send_mail, and debug, and other subsystems
submit command lines.  These are they:

     e_cline_
	Takes one argument, a string, which is passed to cu_$cp for
	execution.  No reattachment of output takes place.  If the
	command line produces output, it will mess up the screen.
	This should only be used when no output is anticipated, and
	indeed should be used then in preference to comout-get-output,
	as it is much faster.

     comout-get-output
	Takes any number of arguments, which may be strings or symbols,
	and catenates them with one space between them to form a
	Multics command line (facilitating things like

	     (comout-get-output 'dl this-seg '-bf)

	).  Reattaches user_output and error_output during the
	execution, rerouting them to a process directory file.  When
	the command execution completes, the contents of the current
	buffer is obliterated (!) and the temporary file read in to it.
	This is the primitive that Comout (^X^E) uses.  e_cline_
	is used by comout-get-output internally.

     These primitives set up a condition handler that catches all "abnormal"
Multics signals and returns.  A very major deficiency at this point, which is
not likely to be remedied in the near future, is that requests for input by
these command lines cannot be dealt with reasonably at all.  In the case of
e_cline_, the user will get the query in raw teletype modes, and will have to
answer it in raw, nonedited teletype modes.  In the case of comout-get-output,
the query will never appear in any form at all, having been routed to the
temporary segment, and the user's process will hang infinitely, the user
not knowing to respond having never seen the query.

     Sometimes it is necessary to get the value of standaard Multics error
codes, from error_table_, into a program, to be able to see if a given
Multics interface has in fact returned it.  The function "error_table_"
(spelled the usual way with underscores, not hyphens) is used for this
purpose.  Its single argument is a symbol, whose name is the name
of the error_table_ entry whose value is sought, and the returned
result is that value, or 1 if it is not a valid entry.

     The error_table_ function optimizes finding the same name over
and over again, so the extension writer need not go through machinations
to "save" an error_table_ value computed by these means.
Here is an example of the use of error_table_:

      (let ((status-result (hcs_$get_user_effmode dir entry "")))
           (if (not (= (cadr status-result) 0) ;the return code
	     (if (= (cadr status-result)(error_table_ 'incorrect_access))
	         (display-error-noabort "Warning: not checking access")
	         else
	         (display-com-error (cadr status-result) dir ">" entry))))


		    Defining commands with defcom
		    _____________________________

     The "Defcom" (short for _d_e_f_i_n_e-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d) facility is a fairly new addition
to Emacs (and thus many internal functions are not converted to use it) for
simplifying the definition of Lisp functions to be used as Emacs commands,
either keystroke requests, or extended commands.  Defcom cooperates
with the Emacs command-reader to provide prompting and defaulting
of unspecified arguments, range-checking of numeric arguments,
automatic repetition for numeric arguments, if desired, cross-connecting
symmetrical functions via negative arguments, and other features.

     Defcom should only be used for defining functions actually to
be used as Emacs commands;  internal and auxiliary
functions to be used by these functions should still be defined with
defun.  Emacs commands defined with defun will continue to work, but
those defined with defcom produce much better diagnostics and
offer more features.  Defcom is actually a technique whereby
the necessary "defun"'s are generated automatically, so functions
defined with defcom may be called from other functions, as well.

     To define a function with defcom, one uses defcom instead of defun,
and supplies no Lisp argument list, i.e.,

   (defcom one-word-from-beginning
	 (go-to-beginning-of-buffer)
	 (forward-word))

This is the simplest form of defcom; optional features are supplied by
placing, between the function name and the function code, various keywords,
all of which begin with the "&" character, and some of which take optional
arguments, expressed as lists.

     The most common optional specification is &numeric-argument,
(or &na for short), which specifies what to do with a supplied numeric
argument, if any.  The keyword &numeric-argument must be followed by
a list of specifications, which must include one of the following
maJor processing types:

	&reject		Any numeric argument is rejected as invalid.
			Clearly, no other specifications are valid
			in this case. This is the default if
			&numeric-argument is not given.
	&ignore		A numeric argument is ignored.
	&repeat		If the argument is positive, the
			command is repeated that many times.
	&pass		The value of the Lisp variable "numarg"
			is set, as in non-defcom commands.

     In addition to the major processing type, optional bounds may
be specified by the keywords &upper-bound (&ub) or &lower-bound (&lb).
These, in turn, must be followed by either an integer  being the bound, or the
keyword &eval followed by an expression to evaluate at the time command
execution is attempted, which will then produce a value (such an expression
will be called an "&eval expression".)  Here are some examples of
&numeric-argument specifications:

	&numeric-argument (&pass)
	&numeric-argument 
		(&repeat &lower-bound 1 &upper-bound &eval (+ max-foos 2))
	&numeric-argument
		(&pass &upper-bound 15.)

     A command defined with defcom may elect to receive Lisp arguments,
that is to say, values which are to be prompted for or supplied as
extended command arguments can be provided automatically, and prompted
for, by the Emacs command reader, and supplied as Lisp arguments to the
command function.  Instead of a normal Lisp argument list, the
keyword &arguments (or &args or &a), followed by list of argument
specifications, one for each Lisp argument to be supplied.

     Each argument specification consists of the Lisp name of the argument,
i.e., the name of the variable which will be referred to inside the function,
and any number of "argument qualifiers", separated by spaces.  Each
argument qualifier may consist of several tokens, as necessary.  Argument
qualifiers specify the prompts, defaults, etc. for an argument.
An argument specification  may also be given as the name of the variable
alone, as opposed ot a list of it and qualifiers.  In this case,
it is equivalent to having its own name as a prompt for its value.

     When a defcom-defined commands is invoked as an extended command,
(i.e., via ESC-X), the Emacs command reader will check the type and
number of command arguments supplied and necessary, and prompt for those not
supplied or default them as specified.  When a defcom-defined
command which has arguments is invoked from a key, it is as if
it were invoked as an extended command with no command arguments given,
and all are either prompted for or defaulted.

     Here are the valid argument qualifiers:

	&string
	&symbol
	&integer		Specify how the argument, when read
			by ESC-X or prompted for is to be converted
			before being passed.  Only one at a time
			of these are valid in a given argument
			specification, and &string (i.e., no
			conversion) is the default.

	&default		Must be followed by either a string,
			symbol, or integer, as consistent with
			the expected data type for this argument,
			or an &eval expression.  Specifies the
			default value to be used if this argument
			is not supplied, or a null response
			is given to a prompt for this argument,
			if any.

	&prompt		Specifies the prompt for this argument, if
			not supplied via ESC-X.  Prompts will be
			put to the user before defaults are evaluated
			or used; A null string causes the &default
			value to be used.  &prompt is followed by
			a prompt string (in quotes)(or an &eval
			expression), and one of the two optional keywords
			NL or ESC, specifying the prompt terminator
			(ESC is obsolete, use NL in all cases).
			If neither NL or ESC is given,
			NL is assumed as the default.

	&rest-as-list	Valid only for the last argument.  Causes
			this variable to be given as a value a
			list of all of the remaining supplied
			arguments, however many they may be. If
			&rest-as-list is used, the caller of this
			function from Lisp (including start-up's written
			by possibly not-Lisp-conscious users)
			must know that the number and organization
			of Lisp arguments is therefore different
			from the apparent argument array given to
			ESC-X.

	&rest-as-string	Valid only for the last argument, causes
			all remaining arguments to be supplied as
			a single string to the function, a single
			argument, as they appeaed to ESC-X, with
			spaces and so forth included.  Same cautions
			as &rest-as-list apply.

     Here is a function definition which accepts three arguments:

(defcom replace-n-times
        &arguments
        ((oldstring &string  &default &eval (get-search-string "Old: "))
         (newstring &string &prompt "New String: " NL)
         (count &integer &prompt "How many times? " NL &default 1))

        (do-times count
	(if (not (forward-search oldstring))(search-failure-annunciator))
	(do-times (stringlength oldstring)(rubout-char))
	(insert-string newstring)))

Note that it can be invoked as

  ESC-X replace-n-times Washington Lincoln 2 CR

or

  ESC-X replace-n-times CR

in which case all arguments will be prompted for, or

   set-perm-key  ^Z9 replace-n-times

followed by striking that key at some time, will prompt for
all arguments, too.  This function is so defined that it may
be called from Lisp as

	(replace-n-times "this" "that" 17)

or whatever, i.e., it is a Lisp function of three arguments.
   
     When defcom-defined commands are re-invoked by ^C, they are
repeated with identical arguments.  This is what makes search-repetition
by ^C work.

     Other than numeric arguments and command arguments, defcom
may be used to spceify prologues, documentation, and negative-functions
of command functions.  Documentation is specified by the
keyword &documentation (or &doc) followed by a documentation
string subject to the same rules as given above under "Documenting
Commands".  Prologues are functions or code to be executed
before any arguments are prompted for, perhaps to check for legal
circumstances for calling this command.  Negative functions are
functions or code to be executed if the command is supplied a negative
numeric argument: the negative function is given the negative numeric
argument made positive.  Prologues and negative functions are
speicifed by the keywords &prologue, or &negative-function
(short, &nf), followed by the name of the appropriate function,
or forms, terminated by &end-code.  Here is an example of the
use of some of these features:

(defcom forward-topic
        &doc "Goes forward one or more topics. See also $$backward-topic$."
        &numeric-argument (&repeat)
        &negative-function backward-topic
        (with-mark m
           (forward-search "Topic::"............

   As this document is extended and augmented, it may not approach true
"completion" in any given length of time.  Thus, there are still "tricks"
and functions that are not documented above.  The extension writer should
study the supplied extensions, such as Fortran Mode (fortran-mode.lisp)
and RMAIL (rmail.lisp), as well as the "fundamental mode extensions"
in e_macops_.lisp.  These programs are found in the Emacs source archive.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
