This package allows you to 
   1) Get printed representations of all keyboard macros defined
      in an environment into a buffer for
         a) Editing them.
         b) Re-defining them from the edited version
         c) Writing them out to a file, for later
	    I) Dprintng
	    II) Getting those macros automatically defined in a later
	        invocation of Emacs.

1. Getting printed representations of all your macros into a buffer.

   Make sure all your macros are hooked up to keys, or at least were at
   some time given names, then,

     ESC-x edit-macros  CR

   will put you in a buffer in "Macro Edit" mode with all the macros
   defined in that buffer in editable form.

  a. Editing them.

In Macro Edit mode, the following functions exist, on these keys:

esc-^A	macedit-find-beginning-of-macdef

	Move to the beginning of the current macro defintion.

esc-^B	macedit-backward-term

	Move backward one term in the keyboard macro.

esc-^C	macedit-compile-to-lisp

	Still under development, works a little bit, but impressive
	even for the little bit it works.  Compiles the macro being
	pointed at into lisp.

esc-^E	macedit-find-end-of-macdef

	Move to the end of the current macro definition.

esc-^F	macedit-forward-term

	Move forward one term in the current macro definition.

esc-^H	macedit-mark-whole-macro

	Put point and mark around the macro definition.

esc-^K	macedit-kill-term

	Kill forward to the end of the current (or next) term in
	the current macro definition.

esc-^N	macedit-forward-macdef

	Move forward to the beginning of the next macro definition.

esc-^P	macedit-backward-macdef

	Move backward to the beginning of the previous macro definition.

esc-^S	macedit-state-keyboard-macro

	Prompt for a key; place the definition of the keyboard macro on
	that key into the buffer at the current point.

b) Redefining them from the edited version:

esc-^Z	macedit-take-up-definition

	Take up into the editor, as a live definition, the current macro
	definition being pointed at.  Use this after editing a macro
	definition to redefine it thusly.


ESC-X load-these-macros

	Accept all the macro definitions in the buffer, redefine them
	all.

c) Writing them out.

   Use ^x^w as normal, any file you want, but if it has the suffix
   ".emacro", it will be automatically find-filed'd into Macro Edit
   mode when it is next find-file'd.

Macro language has PL/I like comments (/* comment... */). ESC-;,
ESC-P, and ESC-N do the right thing. The comment column is 51.
Quoted strings are double-quoted.  Macro definitions look like

   macro foo-the-bar on ^q
     ^S "bar" ESC ESC-# "foo"
   end-macro foo-the-bar

The "on ^q" is optional.  If present, it will cause a set-perm-key
to that macro.

The command

   ESC-X load-macrofile  PATHNAME CR

may be issued at any time to take up one of these macro files and define
all the keyboard macros in it.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
