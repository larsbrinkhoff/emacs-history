______________________________________________________________________


     Multics Emacs is a state-of-the-art text processing and editing system.
A new version is being distributed as part of Release 10.0, as an unbundled
offering.  It offers facilities comparable to stand-alone word-processing
systems, combined with the power of the entire Multics environment.

     Multics Emacs is a very large and complex subsystem which requires
special actions and customizations to be effected by site personnel:
this document specifies these actions.

     Multics Emacs is basically a "real-time video editor."  This means that
as opposed to interacting with a user on a line-by-line basis, modifying text
in response to "command lines", and printing text on demand, a selected
portion of the text being edited is continuously displayed upon a screen.
The terminal identifies a given location in the text via its cursor.
By typing selected characters, the text at the cursor is modified, deleted,
moved, etc., and the image of the text on the screen is dynamically updated
to reflect these changes as they are made.  New text is entered simply
by typing it.  There is no need for a "print" request; text is always visible.
There is no need for a "substitute" request; once undesired text is deleted,
new text is simply entered.

     Responding to characters typed at a keyboard in a real-time video
environment requires careful screen maintenance in response to each character
typed _a_s _i_t _i_s _t_y_p_e_d:  to simply print a character upon the screen
as it is typed requires intelligent screen maintenance.  It is impermissible
to allow the terminal or the front-end processor to echo characters.  Thus,
Multics Emacs must respond to _e_v_e_r_y character as it is typed.
The ability to respond to every single character as it is typed is a new one
for Multics; until now, there was no need for it.  This feature is provided
by _b_r_e_a_k_a_l_l _m_o_d_e, a feature of the Multics Communications
System (MCS).

     Although every effort has been made to streamline the per-character
loop of Emacs and Multics, including extensive modification to the
mainframe and communications processor software, response to every
character "in real time" is innately much more expensive in CPU and paging
than response to "whole lines".  Implementors of real-time video editors
on many systems have all found that these editors are much more expensive
than non-video editors because of this.  Yet, various scenarios of
mainframe time availability, video terminal availability, working hours,
and system resource pricing have made the technology of real-time editing
extremely popular in spite of the innate expense.

      It is the responsibility of the site personnel to make the
commitment to allow this software to be used at all at his or her site,
and if that commitment is made, to ascertain at precisely what point, at
what times of day, and on what configurations does, if at all, Emacs usage
become problematic.  In two and a half years of experience at the Honeywell
exposure sites, UNRESTRICTED Emacs usage has not ONCE created
a performance problem; nevertheless, a very large number of Emacs
users may have a deleterious effect on system performnace.

	    **************************************************

     Multics Emacs is a developing, experimental offering.  It is still
undergoing development.  There are known bugs and deficiencies.  All known
problems and deficiencies are listed in the file emacs.status.info in the
documentation directory >doc>ss>emacs.  In spite of these bugs and problems,
Multics Emacs is eminently usable, quite robust.  Multics Emacs has been in
heavy use at the two Multics development sites for three years, and has
acquired a user community of hundreds.


Emacs' trouble-reporting mechanism is the same as for all other Multics
Software; the TR system should be used.  Please check the known bug list
before generating a trouble report.  We intend to maintain reasonable
compatibility in user interface in future releases; the internal interfaces
available to the extension writer, however, are more subject to change.
However, the intent is to fully document all changes.


	    **************************************************


     The use of Multics Emacs, and its entire repertoire of command and
function, for the installed version, is documented in Honeywell Manual
CH27, "Emacs Text Editor User's Guide".  The writing of user extensions
and terminal support modules (not of interest to anyone except very
advanced users and site maintenance personnel) is documented in Honeywell
Manual CJ52, "Emacs Editor Extension Writer's Guide".

     The unofficial documentation which was the only documentation before
the release of the above-mentioned manuals is distributed in
>doc>ss>emacs,  where this info segment lives.  Starting there, the segment
emacs.gi.info contains all other online documentation pointers.  This
documentation is inteded to be dprinted, and is not suitable for perusal
with the "help" command.  This documentation, however, is completely
up to date, and often contains information in more detail, and
differently organized than the published manuals.

		  ******************************

     Multics Emacs was modelled after the EMACS editor at the MIT Artificial
Intelligence Lab.  EMACS (on the AI Lab PDP-10's) was written, in TECO, by
staff members of the MIT AI Lab and the (MIT) Laboratory for Computer Science
(LCS), without whose encouragement and support this project would not have
been possible.

     Multics Emacs makes no claims to current or future compatibility with
other implementations of EMACS or any other editor.  Although largely
compatible in general philosophy and repertoire with the AI Lab editor, there
are significant differences, both in some specific commands with which we
chose to differ, facilities implemented in one and not the other, and things
that are of necessity different due to the difference in operating systems.
Nevertheless, users familiar with any video editor generally find no problem
whatsoever adapting to another.

     Compatibility with AI Lab EMACS is not a large consideration for the
future.

     Multics Emacs was implemented from scratch at Honeywell with
contributions from some programmers at the MIT Information Processing Center.
No part of any other program on any other system was used, studied, copied,
translated, or otherwise incorporated during the development of Multics Emacs.

	    **************************************************

     Emacs resides in the unbundled library, >system_library_unbundled.
There are four object segments there:

	o   bound_multics_emacs_.  The basic editor, online
	    documentation system, command dispatcher, and display
	    manager.

	o   bound_emacs_packages_.  Various optional features, including
	    the modes for editing PL/I and Lisp programs, the directory
	    and buffer editors, and so on.

	o   bound_emacs_rmail_. The Emacs mail system.

	o   bound_emacs_preinit_. Code needed at the time Emacs modules
	    or extensions are compiled or loaded, including the
	    command definition facility and the default binding tables.

     The source for these segments is kept in the conventionally-named
source archives in the unbundled source library.

		*****IMPORTANT*****

     The terminal-specific knowledge of Emacs is embedded in small Lisp
programs known as "ctls", whose exectuable objects reside in
>unbundled>emacs_ctls.  The site is expected to add terminal control
modules to this directory as needed at each site.  The names on the
"ctl"s, as well as the names on links in the ctl directory, must reflect
the names (in the TTF) for terminals used at your site.  Any terminal
type to be supported by Emacs at your site must have the name
<type>ctl on the appropriate ctl in the ctl directory:  As shipped from
Phoenix, the ctl directory and TTF are consistent; you must adjust
the ctl names for local terminal names in use at your site, as well
as supply new ctls for terminals not supportedd in the distributed release.
The primary names of the segments and links will be the only names
reported (stripped of the "ctl" suffix) in response to user query
about what types of terminals are supported at your site.
Instructions on these matters, as well as writing new ctls,
are given in CJ52, as well as online in ctl-writing.info.  Source for
the ctls is in emacs_ctls.s.archive in the unbundled source library.
There is a link in >unb>emacs_ctls to >unb>e_pl1_.

     People writing emacs "extensions" (see below) are encouraged to use
the source of Emacs as a model; thus, it ought be retained on line, but
need not be.  This is even more true for the terminal control modules.


     Also in the unbundled directory is:

	o emacs.sv.lisp, the "Saved Lisp Environment" from which Emacs
	  initializes its Lisp Environment each it is invoked. This
	  environment is produced by executing the exec_com
	  make_emacs.ec, which is supplied in
	  bound_multics_emacs_.s.archive.  This exec_com _m_u_s_t be
	  executed every time the creates and installs
	  a new version of bound_multics_emacs_ (this is NOT needed
	  for the released version).  The resulting object,
	  emacs.sv.lisp must then be installed in >unbundled.
	  The old saved enviroment need not
	  be renamed, as Emacs only reads it once at startup time,
	  and does not retain pointers to it.

	  The environment must also be "resaved" (i.e., make_emacs.ec
	  executed) if a new version of the program e_binding_table_ is
	  installed in >unbundled (other than the released).
	  This program defines the default key bindings.
	  It is in bound_emacs_preinit_.

	  Failure to re-save the environment when either bound_multics_emacs_
	  or e_binding_table_ is changed will result in users getting
	  the message "Error lisp_linkage_error by .... The version of
	  <programname> is not the same one as was loaded into this
	  environment."  Users will receive this error whenever Emacs
	  is re-invoked in a process after a new version has been installed.
	  Users should be advised to new_proc if they receive this message
	  if dynamic installation of Emacs at your site is a possibility.
	  The environment _m_u_s_t be resaved if any of these programs are
	  changed; new_proc will not alleviate the problem.  A copy of
	  the exec_com also exists in bound_multics_emacs_.s.archive.

	o e-macros.incl, an object program.  This program is the
	  compiled version of the include file, e-macros.incl.lisp.
	  Having this object program, which can be generated by
	  directly compiling the include file, makes use of the
	  include file (which uses this compiled version if
	  locatable) much more efficient.

		  *****************************
		  **********IMPORTANT**********
		  *****************************

     There are several site-specific objects that Emacs expects to find.
These segments used to reside in a directory >sc1>emacs_dir; this
is no longer necessary.  The following are the segments.

	o emacs_info_vfile_, an indexed sequential vfile used by the online
	  documentation system to store command descriptions in encoded form.
	  This MSF vfile resides in >unbundled.  Make sure that
	  users have s on the MSF dir and r on the components.  Experts
	  familiar with the online documentation system can change
	  or augment online command documentation without installations
	  if they have rw to this MSF, thus, it is site modifiable.

	o A segment, metering.acs, access to which controls logging of
	  Emacs usage (see the section below). (Site optional).


There should exist a link in >unb>include, or wherever your site chooses to
put the include file e-define-command.lisp, to e_define_command_ in the
executable directory.  This is needed in order for the two include files,
e-macros.incl.lisp and e-define-command.incl.lisp, to find the program
e_define_command_ at the time these include files are used at extension
compile time.  There must also be a link from wherever the include file
e-macros.incl.lisp is kept to the segment e-macros.incl in the executable
directory.

	    **************************************************

     The table rmail-full-name-table, which used to reside in >sc1>emacs_dir,
is no longer necessary, as its functionallity has been subsumed by the
my-personal-name Emacs variable.

	    **************************************************

     A well-debugged version of the Multics MacLisp subsystem is being
shipped in >unbundled in Release 10.0, specifically for the support of
Multics Emacs.  Honeywell is neither supporting nor documenting Multics
MacLisp in Release 10.0 as other than part of the support of Multics Emacs.


     Multics MacLisp was developed at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, under government funding.  Documentation is available from
the MIT Information Processing Center.  Honeywell currently supports Multics
MacLisp only to the degree required to keep Honeywell-supplied subsystems
implemented in it operative.

     There is an introduction to the language Lisp, in which Multics Emacs
is coded (and "extended") in the file "extensions.info" in the Emacs
documentation directory, as well as in CJ52.  This introduction is felt to
be adequate for those wishing to write their own Emacs "extensions" (see
below), and was written with that in mind.  It is not, however, a general
introduction to the subject, or adequate to fully understand the source
code of the deep levels of the Emacs editor.

     The Multics MacLisp subsystem in the unbundled library is complete and
fully operative.  It is the most advanced version of Multics MacLisp.  The
principal user interfaces are:

     o lisp, the interpreter

     o lcp, lisp_compiler, which can compile source segments named
       <name>.lisp into object segments loadable by the interpreter

     o lap, the Lisp-oriented Multics assembler.

     o display_lisp_object_segment, a tool.

     Honeywell will fix bugs in Lisp that affect Emacs, as shipped in Release
10.0.  We make no statement about any level of future support or documentation,
or continued support even at this level of Multics MacLisp.

	    **************************************************

     Although Multics Emacs is easily used by personnel with no technical
training or programming experience, those with some programming experience
can utilize it even more effectively via "extensions".  Extensions are
fragments of Lisp code, not part of the deep level of the editor, which
imbed knowledge of given problem domains, without knowledge of the internal
data structure of the editor, or even more to the point, of display management,
at all. Examples of supplied extensions are the various language modes
and the Emacs mail subsystem.

     Via extension writing, a given shop can create Emacs environments for
selected (or all) users with locally defined functionality, such as document
formats, special languages, and other text processing considerations,
available on keystrokes to the Emacs user.  Similarly, a user who is not
completely satisfied with the way some Emacs command behaves is encouraged to
look at the source and add his or her own version to his environment.

     It is a major design feature of Multics Emacs that extension, the
development of prepared functionality, is performed in a very powerful,
concise, and clean language, namely Lisp extended by appropriate "Lisp
Macros".  This design differs from that of conventional editors, which use the
same language that they present as a user interface for writing "macros".  By
necessity, those languages are always compromised in both directions,
conciseness for interactive editing, and the diversity of a programming
language for "macro writers".  Emacs does not suffer this deficiency.

     CJ52, "Emacs Extension Writer's Guide," includes a complete explanation
from the ground up of all knowledge about Lisp necessary to write extensions,
including how to debug them interactively within Emacs, and take full
advantage of Lisp mode.  extensions.info, in >doc>ss>emacs, is much of the
same material, but is less complete, less up to date, and less accurate.

     We strongly recommend that some programmer at your site look into
these documents, just to see the type of thing that can be done.  Tailored
Emacs environments provide a way to use all the text processing and display
management power of Emacs to best suit your data processing needs.  It is
our experience that programmers with no background in Lisp at all have
been able to write extensions proficiently in one day; even non-technical
personnel have successfully written extensions.  You will find that
writing "Emacs extensions in Lisp" means very little more than saying
what you want done in English with a pair of parentheses around each line.


	    **************************************************

     An audit trail mechanism exists with Emacs to monitor the usage and
resources consumed by Emacs users.  By default, it is not enabled.  To enable
it, the site should create the segment >unbundled>metering.acs, zero max
length, giving rw access to *.* or all persons/prjects to be audited.  The
site must then modify the segment emacs_data_.cds, which can be found in
bound_multics_emacs_.s.archive, changing the value of "text_data.log_dir" to
the pathname of a directory.  The site must create this directory, put a
terminal quota on it, and give all users (or *.*) being audited sma to this
directory.  An IACL of rw *.* should be put on this directory.  Watching rate
of growth of logs in this directory, and cleaning it out, is the site's
responsibility.  If not cleaned, record quota overflows will prevent people
from using Emacs.  This facility is not "secure", and is intended for
performance monitoring purposes.

     Users will create log segments automatically in this directory,
which can be displayed with the print_log tools.  Entries are of the
three forms:

  98   1426.0 0 Jones.SYSTEMS.a: Entering emacs on VIP7801 none a.l111
 101   1427.1 0 Jones.SYSTEMS.a: (VIP7801) in 11, r0/r4 echo 0/3, out 927.
 101   1427.1 0 Jones.SYSTEMS.a: 1.0 min, v/cpu 1/5 mem 67 paging 1029/1218

The first message, at entry time, gives the user ID, the user's terminal type
as specified to MCS, the user's answer-back, and the line over which the user
is logged in.  The second two messages occur at the time that the user leaves
Emacs.  The first message gives the user name, the terminal type as finally
negotiated with Emacs, the number of input characters, the number of
characters echoed by the supervisor via echo negotiation, the number of
characters echoed by Emacs that would have been echoed by the supervisor were
the system faster than the user's typing, and the number of output characters.
The second message gives, in addition to the user ID, the elapsed real time in
Emacs, virtual and real CPU consumption, memory units (in thousands), and
paging device and all page faults.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
