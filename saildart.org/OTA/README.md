These files were extracted from the [1,OTA] directory in a SAIL/SU-AI
archive dated about 1984.  This archive is made available courtesy of
Bruce Baumgart and the public parts are visible at
https://www.saildart.org/.

The location of the Sine sources was discovered by Lars Brinkhoff via
https://ml.cddddr.org/lisp-forum/msg00539.html

The files are presented here as they were retrieved from Saildart
wrapped in some html formatting.  Those files were extracted from backup
tapes stored as 7-bit ASCII encoded in 36-bit PDP-10 words.  The details
of how these files were transferred from MagicSix to SAIL in 1980 are
lost to history, but they show some artifacts of that process.

* sine.toc - file contains html fragments giving
   * original file date,
   * revision number, and
   * length in bytes.
* convert_octal.pl - a filter for converting 36-bit words printed in
  octal into text using the PDP-10 five character 7-bit ascii encoding.
* octal/ - contains the corresponding octal files.
