Åedits the shell command file [MACRO]

  Shell command execution macros for Version 4.4 and later

	Joe Steffen and Bill Paulson

	This set of macros allows convenient execution of shell commands
 inside emacs.  Shell commands are kept in a "hidden" file
 named $HOME/.commands.  Use Å to edit or move the line pointer in
 this file.  Exit from M-E by ^Z.  M-C displays the current line in
 this file in case you forget.  M-N and M-P move the cursor down and up,
 respectively, in the file and display the current line.  They take an
 argument just like ^N and ^P.  These commands make it easy to switch
 between several command lines without using the M-E macro.
	M-^E will execute the current line in the command file.  If the
 first character of the line is not '!', then any
 output will be captured in .exec just like using ¤.  On return
 from execution, the current buffer will be displayed in the top window,
 and .exec will be displayed in the lower window.  The shell output can
 then be examined as a regular buffer.
	If the first character of the line is '!', the output will be 
 displayed on the screen  as the command(s) are being executed
 just like using ¡.  This allows you to abort a program that is in an
 infinite loop, or to enter program input interactively.  Entering 'n'
 in place of a space when you get the "Continue?" prompt will execute the
 ^Xs macro described later.
	Note that the command line can contain multiple commands separated
 by semicolons.  Since emacs allows a line to be several hundred
 characters long, entire shell scripts can be executed.
	Note also that you can use å while editing the command buffer
 with Å.  Thus you can test the command line and quickly change it if
 it contains an error.

sescapes to the shell (enter ^D to exit) [MACRO]

	Joe Steffen, Version 4.0

	This macro executes the shell interactively
	instead of prompting for each command.  This allows cd
	commands to stay in effect and allows you to see the results of
	several commands.  The prompt is changed to 'emacs' to remind you
	that you are still within emacs.  Enter ^D instead of a null line to
	return to emacs.
