This directory contains a library of emacs macros for various purposes.
Any macros submitted to this library should follow these rules:


	Name and description (the first word of the comment on the
	first line of a macro should be a unique macro name, right
	after the ^\).
	
	A block of comments before any of the code describing in
	more detail what the macro did, who wrote it, what version
	of EMACS is needed to run it, and ways in which the user may
	wish to customize it.
	
	Comments on any lines that do something non-obvious (i.e.
	what is in the kill stack when it is used to supply a
	parameter to something.
	
	When one macro calls another, use M-x.  Do not just invoke
	them with a character sequence, so that a user can re-define
	which character yours macros are on without screwing up the
	macros. 
	
	Any macro that is not intended to be invoked by a character
	sequence should be assigned to ^X^[ (control-x escape),
	which is a highly improbable sequence to be useful for
	anything else.

	
I am sure that we will be developing and using lots of macros, and
that a lot of people will be looking at our macros, thus I think
that this kind of detail is essential to try to avoid problems.
