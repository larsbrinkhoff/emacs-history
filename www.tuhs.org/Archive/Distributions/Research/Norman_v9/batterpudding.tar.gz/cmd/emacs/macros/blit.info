	Information for blit owners on emacs related blit software
		
		
There are two macro libraries for use with the blit and the etty
terminal emulator.  Etty downloads into a layer and provides
enhanced terminal functions that can be used by emacs, vi, and other
screen tools.  When run with etty, the macro libraries blit
or blit_dired can be loaded to allow the user to use the mouse for
pointing and menu selection.  In general, button 1 on the mouse is
used for pointing, and button two makes selections on the menu. 
Some of the menu selections change the menu or cause positioning to
be interpreted differently.  In general, a single push with the
mouse standing still causes the cursor to move to that spot, while
pushing button one and sweeping out a region before releasing the
button causes some function (settable by a menu selection) to be
performed on the selected region.

the blit library has the following functions:

M-O	Download the cursor and function keys for emacs (doesn't yet
	work on the Super blit)

M-#	Sent by pushing button 1 of the mouse, this macro reads the
	position information from the mouse push and positions the
	cursor there.  It will cross windows when running in two
	window mode.
	

M-&	Sent at the end of a mouse push that selects a region.  This
	Command is mapped to one of the following 3 commands
	according to the mode selected by selecting mouse action
	from the second menu.
	
^X-A	Kill region - deletes region swept out by the mouse
^X-C	Pickup region - picks it up onto the kill stack
^X-D	Mark region - marks the selected region.

The following commands are bound to various menu selections.  There
are two menues, the custom menu and standard menu.  The terminal
file for etty loads the standard menu, while the macro bound to the
custom menu selection loads it.

M-H	Go to top of the screen	
M-L	Go to bottom of the screen
M-M	Go to middle of the screen
M-^N	Scroll back one line
M-^P	Scroll up one line
^XM	Display the custom menu
^Xs	Display the standard menu
^X6	Set the action of the mouse on a region.  The next thing
	done MUST be a menu selection (using button 2) from one of
	the 3 alternatives.  Anything else will be ignored.
	
^X5	Change buffers - this macro is bound to a menu item and
	displays a list of active buffers.  The next thing done MUST
	be selection of one of the lines with the mouse.  Anything
	else will be interpreted as a mouse push and will likely
	result in going into a new empty buffer with a very strange
	name.
	
^X4	Kill region - This command expects the next two actions to
	be mouse pushes (button 1) and deletes the region between
	them.
	
^X3	Scroll bar - This command displays a scroll bar at the
	botton of the screen.  The scroll bar is 50 characters long
	and has  X's representing the part of the file that is
	before the cursor and -'s for that part that is after.  The
	next action MUST be a mouse selection of a character on the
	line (actually, you can push anywhere, only the horizontal
	position counts), and will cause a move to the appropriate
	spot in the file.
