Contents of This Distribution Kit
=================================

The package consists of two archives; `dem120e.lzh' and `dem120s.lzh'. 
You need LHarc or LHa utility to unpack these archives. Don't forget to
use `/mx' switches with `-x' option to unpack them. For example do as
following.

     lharc x /mx dem120e.lzh
     lharc x /mx dem120s.lzh

And similarly apply these options to the archives which are contained by
them.

After unpacking, following files will appear.

How to Install
==============

Demacs requires special version of `go32.exe' DOS extender. This package
includes it with its name `bin\demacspc.exe' for IBM PC or
`bin\demacs98.exe' for PC-9801 series. You should use one of them with
renameing to `demacs.exe'.

Since `go32.exe' which came along with the package of DJ's GCC/G++
version 1.05 can not handle `Ctrl-C' properlly, we modified it to work
correctly. And we made some changes to be able to handle more DOS
function call, and enhanced its memory management strategy (detail, see
below).

Installation procedure is quite easy. 

  1. If your system is IBM PC variant (including AX and J-3100 series),
     copy `bin/demacspc.exe' to the directory in PATH with its name
     `demacs.exe'.

     If your system is NEC PC-9801 or EPSON PC-386 series, copy
     `bin/demacs98.exe' to the directory in PATH with its name
     `demacs.exe'.

  2. Copy `bin\demacs' in the same directory with `demacs.exe'.

  3. Create `lisp' and `etc' directory in `\lib\emacs' directory.

  4. If you want to use lisp library, get original lisp files from
     somewhere and copy them in `\lib\emacs\lisp' directory. Then unpack
     `lisp.lzh' in `\lib\emacs' directory.

  5. Unpack `etc.lzh' in `\lib\emacs' directory.

  6. Set TERM environment variable for your system (See following example).

  7. Set TERMCAP variable if `termcap' file is not stay under `\etc'.

  8. Prepare your `_emacs' (`.emacs' on Unix system) under your HOME
     directory if you need it.

`C>set DEMACS_KEEP=1024'
     amount of extended memory to keep (detail, see below).

`C>set SHELL=c:\command.com'
     your command interpreter path.



Options of DOS Extender `demacs.exe'
====================================

`-keep [NUM]'
     When `demacs.exe' invokes a child process, `demacs.exe' does not
     swap out contents of the extended memory to a disk. If NUM is
     specified, `demacs.exe' uses up to NUM killo bytes of extended
     memory.

     You should use this option with XMS or VCPI memory manager. If not, may
     cause violation.

More about `-keep' opiton:

`demacs.exe' provides virtual memory mechanism. If an application (e.g. 
Demacs) requires more memory than equipped real memory, `demacs.exe'
write out a portion of real memory to a disk in order to make a free
memory, then `demacs.exe' assigns the new free memory to the
application. This is called "swapping".

Swapping does not only happen when real memory shortage, but also
happens when `demacs.exe' calls a child process. That is, before
execution of the child process, `demacs.exe' swapps out all of allocated
memory to a disk so that the child process can use memory.
Unfortunatly, swapping takes very long time because Demacs is a huge
program.

In order to eliminate this swapping time, our `demacs.exe' can take
`-keep' option. `-keep' option requests to `demacs.exe' NOT to swap out
contents of extended memory (conventional memory (less than 640KB) is
always swapped out).

In case you use XMS driver such as `himem.sys', since `demacs.exe'
obtains all of free extended memory at startup, a child process can not
use any extended memory (Remember GCC/G++ requires extended memory).
You can reserve extended memory for the child process by following NUM
to `-keep', e.g. ``-keep 1024''. NUM which is killo byte unit number
limits amount of usage of extended memory by `demacs.exe'. If less
amount of extended memory is available than NUM at startup, `demacs.exe'
uses all of extended memory.

Otherwise in case you use VCPI driver such as `QEMM' or `EMM386',
`demacs.exe' gets extended memory on demand basis. ``-keep NUM'' limits
amount of extended memory used by `demacs.exe' to NUM killo bytes.

The following table shows a brief summary.


                   | swap out          |
                   | extended memory   |
                   | at fork child     | extended memory for child
     --------------+-------------------+------------------------------
     without -keep |  YES              | all of extended memory at startup
     -keep         |  NO               | nothing
     -keep <num>   |  NO               | extended memory at startup - num


Too small NUM makes Demacs slower. I recommend to set NUM at
least 512.

Example (Demacs uses 1024KB extended memory):

     demacs.exe -keep 1024

NUM can be also specified by DEMACS_KEEP environment variable. If both
environment variable and option are specified, option has priority. If
you don't need to specify NUM with `-keep' option, specify the value `0'
with this environment variable.



Options of Demacs
=================

Type `demacs [-keep [NUM]] [options]' to invoke Demacs. If you need more
information, see "GNU Emacs manual".

File Type: Text or Binary Translation
=====================================



Translation Mode
----------------

On MS-DOS file system, a line is ended with CR (0x0d)/LF (0x0a)
characters and a file is ended with `Ctrl-Z' character. But on UNIX file
system, a line is ended with only LF character, and end of data meas end
of file.

Treating "binary files" which contains `Ctrl-Z' characters and for
compatibility to UNIX file system, C I/O library on MS-DOS has following
two translation mode which control these characters.

   * Text mode translation
   * Binary mode translation

With text mode translation, on reading, CR/LF code are translated to CR
and reading is terminated as soon as `Ctrl-Z' appears. On writing, LF is
added to CR and `Ctrl-Z' is added to end of file.

With binary mode translation, no code is translated.

Demacs supports these two translation mode, and manage them on each
buffer. You can find current translation mode of the buffer from file
type mnemonic on the mode line.

     --**-Emacs: demacs.tex   (T:Texinfo)--42%---------------
                               ^

File type mnemonic means

`T'
     Text mode translation.
`B'
     Binary mode translation.

We call this translation mode which is managed on each buffer "file
type".



Demacs Buffer Management
------------------------



File Type of Each Buffer
........................

File type of each buffer is stored on buffer-local `file-type' variable. 
To set the value of `file-type' use the `set-file-type' function.

The default value of `file-type' is the value of `default-file-type'
variable. To set its value, use the `set-default-file-type' function.

## Local Variable: file-type
     `0'
          Text mode translation.
     `1'
          Binary mode translation.

## Command: set-file-type TYPE &optional BUFFER
     This function sets buffer-local `file-type' variable of BUFFER to
     TYPE. The argument BUFFER defaults to the current buffer. The value
     of TYPE is one of followings.
     `0' or `'text' or `"text"'
          Specify the buffer's file type to text mode.
     `1' or `'binary' or `"binary"'
          Specify the buffer's file type to binary mode.

## Global Variable: default-file-type
     The value of this grobal bariable is the default value of
     buffer-local `file-type' variable.

## Command: set-default-file-type TYPE
     This function sets the value of `default-file-type' variable to
     TYPE. The value of TYPE is one of followings.
     `0' or `'text' or `"text"'
          Specify the buffer's file type to text mode, by default.
     `1' or `'binary' or `"binary"'
          Specify the buffer's file type to binary mode, by default.



Buffer Creation
...............

When creating a new buffer, Demacs set the buffer's local variable
`file-type' to the value of the `default-file-type' variable.



Reading Files into Demacs Buffers
---------------------------------

Using the `define-file-name-file-type' function, you can define file
type associated with file name.

For example, 

     (define-file-name-file-type "\\.mem$" 'binary)

defines that file type of files having extention `.mem' is binary.

By default, the files ending with `.elc', `.obj', `.exe', `.com',
`.lib', `.sys' (except `config.sys'), `.chk', `.o', `.a' and `.out' are
defined as binary file type. This is defined in `demacs.el'.

## Function: define-file-name-file-type FILENAME TYPE
     This function defines file type associate with file name. FILENAME
     is regular expression or `nil'. `nil' matches any file anme. TYPE
     is file type.

## Function: find-file-type-from-file-name FILENAME
     This function returns file type which associate with FILENAME
     defined by `define-file-name-file-type' function. If no file type
     is defined, this returns a value of `default-file-type'.



Inserting Files into Buffers
............................

When inserting a file already visiting buffer, Demacs calls the
`find-file-type-from-file-name' function with file name of target file
as its argument, and set return value to file type of the buffer.



Visiting Files and Reading
..........................

When visiting a file and reading into a buffer, Demacs calls the
`find-file-type-from-file-name' function with file name of target file
as its argument, and set return value to file type of the buffer.



Creating Files and Visiting
...........................

The `find-file-not-found-set-file-type' function is appended to
the `find-file-not-found-hooks' variable. This means that
`find-file-not-found-set-file-type' is called when the visiting
file not exists.

This function calls internally the `find-file-type-from-file-name'
function with target name as its argument and set return value to file
type of the buffer.



Writing Buffers into Files
--------------------------

When writing a buffer into a file, Demacs set translation mode to file
type of the buffer.



Process I/O
-----------

Demacs communicate with external process (child process) using temporary
file. The `default-file-type' variable is used as file type of the
buffer which displays result.



"8bit clean" Display Mode
=========================

Demacs supports so called "8bit clean" display mode, which displays 8bit
dirty characters as it is instead of backslashed or arrowed form.

If you want use this mode, execute command `toggle-pass8-mode'. You can
find in mode line whether the buffer is in "8bit clean" display mode.

     --**-Emacs: foo.bar      (T:Fundamental Pass8)--28%---------------
                                             ^^^^^

To return ordinary display mode, again execute command
`toggle-pass8-mode'.

If you want create a buffer always in "8bit clean" display mode, place

     (setq-default pass8-mode t)

in your startup file.

## Local Variable: pass8-mode
     If this variable is `*Non-nil', Demacs displays 8bit dirty
     characters as it is. Default value is `nil'.

## Command: toggle-pass8-mode
     Set/Unset the buffer local variable `pass8-mode'.



8086 Software Interrupt
=======================

Function `int86' generate 8086 software interrupt. DOS Extender
`demacs.exe' not handle all interrupts, so some interrupts are treated
as exception and may cause violation. Use this carefully.

Use this function like this.

     int
     GetDisk ()
     {
       union REGS regs;
       regs.h.ah = 0x19;     /* 25 */
       int86 (0x21 /* 33 */, &regs, &regs);
       return regs.h.al;
     }

C funtion to get current disk number may write in Demacs as follows:

     (defun get-disk ()
       (let ((regs (make-register)))
         (set-register-value regs 'ah 25)    ; 0x19
         (int86 33 regs)                     ; 0x21
         (register-value regs 'al)))

## Function: make-register
     Generate instance of register type which is passwd to `int86'
     function.

## Function: register-value REGISTER NAME
     Get the value of REGISTER's NAME. NAME is one of followings.

     `'ax'
          `ax' register
     `'bx'
          `bx' register
     `'cx'
          `cx' register
     `'dx'
          `dx' register
     `'si'
          `si' register
     `'di'
          `di' register
     `'cflag'
          carry flag
     `'flags'
          flag register

     or

     `'al'
          lower byte of `ax' register
     `'ah'
          upper byte of `ax' register
     `'bl'
          lower byte of `bx' register
     `'bh'
          upper byte of `bx' register
     `'cl'
          lower byte of `cx' register
     `'ch'
          upper byte of `cx' register
     `'dl'
          lower byte of `dx' register
     `'dh'
          upper byte of `dx' register

## Function: set-register-value REGISTER NAME VALUE
     Set REGISTER's NAME to VALUE. VALUE is unsigned integer.

## Function: int86 INTNO REGISTER
     Generate 8086 software interrupt of number INTNO with REGISTER. 
     This returns set of register value.



Machine Specified Features
==========================
	
New lisp variable `dos-machine-type' is introduced for support various
machines.

## Global Variable: dos-machine-type
     Set one of `ibmpc', `j3100', `pc98' to select machine specific
     code.



IBM PC
------

If you use IBM PC, evaluate `(setq dos-machine-type 'ibmpc)', then
`Ctrl-SPACE' will generate null code and `meta-flag' will works.



Toshiba J-3100
--------------

If you have J-3100, evaluate `(setq dos-machine-type 'j3100)', then 
following functions will be abailable in addition to IBM PC features.

     set-cursor-mode
     get-screen-mode
     set-cursor-mode
     set-keyclick
     set-screen-mode

See `lisp/dos-fns.el' for more information.



NEC PC-9801, EPSON PC-386
-------------------------

If you have PC-9801 or EPSON PC-386, evaluate `(setq
dos-machine-type 'pc98)', then following functions will be abailable.

     pc98-assign-special-key
     pc98-cancel-special-key

See `src/dosfns.c' for more information.



Other Demacs Features
=====================

  1. Filename Completion

     Demacs provides filename completion feature. Filename may include
     drive name in its front. For example, we assume the current
     directory is `c:/tools/emacs' and there is a file `d:/config.sys',
     under this condition `C-x C-f' invokes `find-file' function then
     the function prompts like

          Find file: c:/tools/emacs/

     at this point your typing of `d:/confi' and TAB key causes:

          a:/tools/emacs/d:confi^I  -> d:/config.sys [sole complete]

  2. Child Process

     Function `suspend-emacs' calls sub shell. Try `C-z' and a new
     command shell is invoked.

     Function `call-process' calls sub shell like `suspend-emacs' but
     its stdout is redirected to a temporary file and it will be
     displayed after completion of the process. Try `M-!'. But don't
     call programs which require input from keyboard, because Demacs
     can't response to them.


  3. Enhanced Dired

     This package includes enhanced dired-mode by Sebastian Kremer and their
     dos ported codes which works without UNIX compatible `ls.exe'.

     To use this, extract `edired.lzh' to your lisp directory and put
     lines

          (setq dired-mode-map nil)
          (load "emacs-19")
          (autoload 'dired "dired" nil t)

     to your startup file (`direddos.elc' is loaded from `dired.elc'). 

     If you have `ls.exe', append

          (setq dired-load-hook
                '(lambda ()
                   (setq dired-ls-program "ls")))

     to your startup file. If you use Demacs with `-keep' option, this
     configration works faster than former one.

     You can get more infomation from `dired.README' and its document
     string.



Restrictions
************

   * Demacs does not support asyncronous process. Therefore you can not use
     standard `compile.el', `shell-mode.el' and etc. I think it's
     too painful, so, customized `compiled.el' and `dired.el' are
     provided. See lisp directory.

   * `Ctrl-G' can't generate inturrupt signal. So you can't quit lisp-form
     like this:

          (while t ())

     You shoud use the following form instead of it.

          (while (not (input-pending-p)) ())

   * Demacs backup filename convension is following.

     Base backup filename is made from following rule.

          foo      ->  foo.~
          foo.c    ->  foo.c~
          foo.tex  ->  foo.te~

     Since DOS filename rule (8.3) is too tight, numeric backup such like
     `foo.c.~2~' can not be used.

     Similarly auto save filename is made from following rule.

          abcdefgh ->  #abcdefg.#
          foo.c    ->  #foo.c#
          foo.tex  ->  #foo.te#

     Similarly, auto-save file name is created.

   * If you don't configure XMS or VCPI driver and invoke Demacs with
     `-keep' option, child process Demacs (or go32 application) will
     *not* work correctly.

   * If you use VCPI manager and you have less extended memory than
     300KB, Demacs will hang up or being to work *VERY* slowly. Plese
     give Demacs much memory if you met this.



Compilation
***********

If you wish to recompile Demacs, 'GJ's GCC/G++' (GNU C compiler for DOS)
and original Emacs source are required.

Diffs to the original Emacs source files are included in
`src\diffs.lzh'. Unpack the archive. The files in `diffs.lzh' are not
`diff' form but they are full source files, so you need not to apply
patch.  You may need to alter makefile.

Then run `make -f xmakefile all' command. Make generates `temacs' and
`demacs'.  Caution! just `make' will destroy `xmakefile'. I prepared
`xmake.bak' for you.

Note that all modifications are embeded by `#ifdef MSDOS' and
`#endif MSDOS', so you may follow my modifications easily. Machine
specified codes are embedded in similar flags.

         *.h *.c (C source files)
            |
      ------| make
      |     | 
      |     V
      |   temacs (plain demacs) and lisp/*.el (lisp source files)
      |     | 
      |     | go32 temacs -batch -l loadup.el dump
      |---->|
            V
          xemacs

Provided `bin/temacs' enables you to reconfigure demacs without
recompilation. After editing lisp sources which are loaded up by
`loadup.el', run `go32 temacs -batch -l loadup.el dump'.



Terminal Specified Features
***************************

If your machine is IBM PC or its compatibles, set environment variable
TERM with `ibmpc', then you can use cursor keys and functon
keys.

The functions which is assigned to those keys are as follows:

If you want to append and/or change the function, use lisp variable
`term-setup-hook'. See `lisp/term/ibmpc.el'.

If you don't need cursor and function keys, append next line to
`$HOME/_emacs':

     (setq term-file-prefix nil)
