DESCRIPTION
===========

Several TeX DVI translators are available.  They all expect the
name of the DVI file on the command line, and the extension
`.dvi' can always be omitted.  As illustrated below, they issue a
one-line identifier message and, if no command line arguments are
given, type a Unix-style usage message.  Some of them may have
additional help files.  On case-sensitive file systems, file
names may be expected to be entirely in lower case, so you should
type `dvialw' instead of `DVIALW'.

For all except DVIBIT (which is intended for interactive
display), the output file will be given the name of the
`.dvi' file, but extension `.dvi-xxx', where `xxx'
is the three-character mnemonic for the translator program.  If
long extensions are not supported, then `.xxx' is used.  For
DVIBIT, output is on `stdout' which defaults to the
terminal; it may be redirected in the usual Unix fashion by
`>filename' on the command line (e.g. `dvibit foo
>foo.out').

As each `.dvi' file is processed, a list of errors is printed on
the standard error unit `stderr'; this list is also saved in a
file with extension `.dvi-err', or if long extensions are not
supported by the host, then extension `.err' is used.  This file
is not created if there are no errors.  As each page is printed,
the physical page number and the TeX page number(s) are printed
without a following carriage return; after the last page, the
string `[OK]' is printed, followed by a carriage return.  This
gives a convenient progress report to the terminal.  If it is not
wanted, then the error output can be redirected into a file
(possibly the null device) (e.g.  `dvixxx foo &foo.err'), or the
-q option can be given to suppress it.

These drivers are written in C, and with C preprocessor
conditional compilation features, are all derived from one
master set of files, so that there is substantial code
sharing among them.  Host machine and output device
dependencies are parametrized to allow easy movement to new
hosts and new output devices.  Implementations now exist on
Gould UNIX, Hewlett-Packard UNIX, PC DOS, TOPS-20, VAX UNIX,
and VAX VMS, with others in progress.

OPTIONS
=======

The order of command options and DVI file names is not
significant; all switch values apply to all DVI files.  DVI files
are processed in order from left to right.

Letter case is ignored in option switches: -A and -a are
equivalent.

-a     
     Implement virtual font caching, if possible.  When a font
     file is opened, a buffer is allocated to contain the entire
     file, and the file is then read with one system call.  This
     is important primarily on networked file systems, where the
     many random-access calls in the font file for small amounts
     of data entail substantial network overhead.  With the
     entire file cached in local memory, this overhead is
     removed.  The additional memory required for the font file
     buffers amounts to 100K to 200K bytes (assuming the compact
     .PK font file format), which is not excessive.  If memory
     cannot be allocated for a font file, then normal buffering
     of small blocks is used.  A trace option (-d64) is provided
     to monitor the font caching; see below.
     
-b     
     Backwards order printing from the default.  For example,
     laser printers using the Canon engine print normally receive
     pages in reverse order because they stack printed side up.
     Some have page handling mechanisms that stack them face
     down, and in such a case -b will ensure that they come out
     in order 1, 2, ... instead of n, n-1, n-2, ...
     
-c#     
     Print # copies of each output page.  Page copies are printed
     consecutively; this does not give multiple collated copies
     of the entire job.
     
-d#     
     Produce debugging output on `stderr' if a non-zero value is
     given.  Multiple -d switches may be specified, and one may
     also add values of the following possible options to obtain
     the switch value:
     
     1     
          (DVIJET only) print page bitmap in hexadecimal;
     2     
          display page coordinates and metrics of each output
          character, and print each character bitmap in
          hexadecimal;
     4     
          (DVIJEP only) display updated page coordinate of each
          character after each call to `fixpos()';
     8     
          print filename and open mode of each successful file
          opening;
     16     
          print filename and open mode of each unsuccessful
          file opening;
     32     
          show discarded off-page text;
     64     
          trace virtual font caching;
     128     
          trace character setting (lots of output).
     
     For example, either -d8 -d16 or -d24 will trace all
     attempted file openings.
     
-eVAR=value     
     Define an environment variable on the command line (see the
     later section Environment Variables).  The acceptable values
     for `VAR' are `DVIHELP', `FONTLIST', `TEXFONTS', and
     `TEXINPUTS'.  Under normal use of the translators, these can
     be set by TOPS-20 and VAX VMS `define VAR: value' commands,
     or by Unix `csh' `setenv VAR value' or `sh' `VAR=value'
     commands.  When the translator is invoked by another
     program, such as a print spooler, on some systems it may not
     be possible to set a particular value of an environment
     variable for the subprocess, so this option gets around this
     limitation.  On most Unix systems, it should be possible to
     use the call `system("VAR=value; dvixxx filename")'.
     
-ffontsubfile     
     Define an alternate font substitution file which is to be
     used instead of the default ones (see below).
     
-l     
     Inhibit logging.
     
-m#     
     Reset magnification to #.  The default for low resolution
     printers is -m603, corresponding to 1/1.2**5 magnification
     of 300-dot/inch fonts.  By TeX conventions, magnification
     1000 corresponds to a 200-dot/inch output device.  The
     default magnification is always adjusted according to the
     output device resolution in order to give a normal page
     size, so this parameter should rarely be required.  Legal
     values are int((1000 or 1440 or 1500) x 1.2**{k/2}) (k =
     -16...16); other values will be set to the nearest in this
     family.  Not all fonts will be available in this wide range,
     and most installations will probably have only a half dozen
     or so magnifications.
     
     Magnification values less than 25 are taken to be a TeX
     magstep parameter which is applied to the standard
     magnification for that device.  For example, -m-0.5 selects
     a smaller size, and -m2 selects a size 1.44 times larger
     than normal.
     
-o# or -o#:# or -o#:#:#     
     Specify a page number, or range of page numbers, to be
     selected for output.  In the third form, the last number is
     the page number step size; it is normally 1.  This option
     may be specified any number of times.  If it is not
     specified, then all pages will be printed.  Pages are
     numbered in order 1, 2, 3, ... in the file, but any page
     number recorded by TeX on the printed page will in general
     be different.  Negative page numbers count backward; -1 is
     the last page in the document, -2 the second last page, and
     so on.
     
     As pages are selected for printing, `[#{#}' will be printed
     on `stderr', where the first `#' is the page number in the
     file, and the second `#' is a string of values of the TeX
     counters, `\count0' through `\count9', separated by dots,
     with trailing zero counters dropped.  `\count0' usually
     records the printed page number.  When the page is
     completely output, a closing ] will be printed on `stderr'.
     Any error messages from processing of that page will
     therefore occur between the square brackets.  For example,
     -o1:3 -o12 -o17:23 -o-3:-1 would select pages 1, 2, 3, 12,
     17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23, plus the last three pages.
     
     Pages are processed in the order found in the DVI file;
     there is intentionally no attempt made to sort them
     according the `\count0' values, since different macro
     packages may use this counter for different purposes, and in
     the case of floating tables and figures, the pages may not
     be in order anyway.  Pages will always be printed in an
     order appropriate for the device so that the first document
     page occurs first face up in the document stack; the -b
     option can be used to reverse this order.  For example, some
     Hewlett-Packard Laser Jet Plus printers are equipped with a
     page flipper which stacks output face down; for these, the
     -b option will ensure that the pages come out in the
     expected order.
     
     Specification of a page number step size is useful for
     producing duplex (two-sided) printing.  For example, with
     laser printers using the Canon LBP-CX engine, the first run
     could specify -o1:9999:2, which would stack output face up,
     beginning with the last page, and ending with page 1 on top.
     The printed pages can then be reinserted in the input tray
     face up, page 1 on the top, exactly as they were found in
     the output tray, with the top of the page in the tray
     closest to the end which is inserted first into the printer.
     A second run with -b -o2:9999:2 would then print pages 2, 4,
     ..., on the backs of pages 1, 3, ...; note the -b option to
     get backwards order on the second run.
     
     There is a bug in Microsoft C's sscanf() on the IBM PC; it
     does not correctly parse input on the format "%d:%d:%d" in
     option() for the page number switch.  It correctly returns
     the numbers, but instead of returning the number of such
     items parsed, it returns -1, which should only happen if
     none are parsed.  A work around seems to be to supply a
     trailing colon on the switch, so that you write -o17:
     instead of -o17.
     
-p     
     Inhibit font preloading.  This may produce output a few
     seconds earlier when all pages are output, but should have
     negligible effect on the execution time, and consequently,
     should normally not be specified.  When individual pages are
     being printed with the -o# option, preloading is necessary
     (and will be forced) to ensure that all fonts are defined
     before they are referenced.
     
-q     
     Quiet mode.  Status displays to `stderr' are suppressed,
     unless warning or error messages are issued.  For
     interactive devices (DVIBIT), warning messages are
     suppressed.
     
-r#     
     (Device = HP Laser Jet only).  Specify the Laser Jet output
     resolution in dots per inch.  # must be one of 75, 100, 150,
     or 300.  The actual plot file is identical in each case;
     only the size on the output page is changed, because the
     resolution change is effected by printing 1 x 1, 2 x 2, 3 x
     3, or 4 x 4 pixel blocks.
     
-r     
     (Device = Golden Laser 100 only).  Select run-length
     encoding of the output file.  This reduces disk space
     typically by 10% to 40%, but increases host CPU time for the
     preparation of the output file.
     
-r     
     (Device = Apple ImageWriter only).  Select run-length
     encoding of the output file.
     
-r     
     (Device = Toshiba P-1351 only).  Select run-length encoding
     of the output file.  This reduces disk space typically by
     10% to 40%, but increases host CPU time for the preparation
     of the output file, and because of poor logic in the
     printer, may double the print time!  The print quality is
     also substantially worse, so this option is generally not
     recommended.
     
-s#     
     (Device = Apple LaserWriter only).  Force characters larger
     than # pixels wide or high to be reloaded each time they are
     required.  The Version 23.0 PostScript interpreter has a bug
     which manifests itself in fatal `VM error' messages when
     large characters are sent.  A reasonable default value has
     been set for this which should normally avoid the problem.
     Specifying -s0 will cause reloading of every character each
     time it is used.
     
-v     
     (Device = Apple LaserWriter only).  Force reloading of all
     required fonts at start of each page.
     
-x#units     
     The -x options specify the left margin of the TeX page on
     the output page in any of the indicated units.  Letter case
     is not significant in the units field, which must not be
     separated from the number by any space.  # may be
     fractional.  For example, -x1.0in, -x2.54cm, -x72.27pt, and
     -x6.0225pc all specify a one-inch left margin.  Negative
     values are permissible, and may be used to shift the output
     page left (possibly truncating it on the left) in order to
     display a wide TeX page.
     
     The units field is mandatory, and may be one of
     
     bp     
          big point (1in = 72bp)
     cc     
          cicero (1cc = 12dd)
     cm     
          centimeter (1in = 2.54cm)
     dd     
          didot point (1157dd = 1238pt)
     in     
          inch
     mm     
          millimeter (10mm = 1cm)
     pc     
          pica (1pc = 12pt)
     pt     
          point (72.27pt = 1in)
     sp     
          scaled point (65536sp = 1pt)
     
-y#units     
     The -y options specify the top margin of the TeX page on the
     output page in any of the indicated units.  Letter case is
     not significant in the unit field, which must not be
     separated from the number by any space.  # may be
     fractional.  For example, -y1.0in, -y2.54cm, -y72.27pt, and
     -y6.0225pc all specify a one-inch top margin.  Negative
     values are permissible, and may be used to shift the output
     page up (possibly truncating it on the top) in order to
     display a long TeX page.
     
     
     By decree of the Stanford TeX Project, the default TeX page
     origin is always 1 inch over and down from the top-left page
     corner, even when non-American paper sizes are used.  This
     corresponds to the switch settings -x1in -y1in; these values
     are assumed unless overridden.
     
-z     
     (TOPS-20 or 4.xBSD Unix only).  For each DVI file processed,
     type in an EXEC command `DVISPOOL: dvifilename' (on Unix,
     `DVISPOOL dvifilename') followed by a newline; the user may
     then define `DVISPOOL:' (or `DVISPOOL') to be a program
     which sends the translation of the DVI file to the
     appropriate output spooler.

SAMPLE EXECUTION
================

Here is a sample execution of LaTeX and DVIALW extracted from
a TOPS-20 PHOTO log:

     LaTeX biblio.ltx

     [1 pages]

     [1{1}]  [OK]

When the TOPS-20 version of TeX finishes execution, it
normally simulates terminal input of a line of the form

     TeXspool: dvifile

without supplying a final carriage return.  The default value of
the logical name `TeXspool:' points to a dummy program which
does nothing, so if you just type a carriage return yourself, the
line is effectively ignored.  This is reasonable in that it
usually takes several trips through TeX before you have a
`.dvi' file worth printing.  If you like, you can redefine
`TeXspool:' to point to your favorite DVI translator, for
example,

     define TeXspool: sys:dvialw.exe

Then when you type a carriage return when TeX finishes, it
will run the translator immediately, saving you a line of typing.
If you do not want the translator to run, just cancel the line by
typing  or .

A sample invocation of DVITYPE is as follows:

     @dvitype
     DVIFILE    : story.dvi
     OUTPUT     : tty:
     This is DVItype, Tops-20 Version 2.8

FONT SUBSTITUTION
=================


If no -ffontsubfile option is given, and font substitution is
required, if the current DVI file is `foo.dvi', then the files
`foo.sub', `texfonts.sub', and `texinputs:texfonts.sub' will be
tried in order.  The first two will be found on the current
directory, and the last is the system default.  This gives the
option of document-specific, user-specific, and system-specific
substitutions, and the -f option allows all of these to be
overridden.

Font substitution lines have the form:

     % comment
     oldname.oldmag  ->      subname.submag  % comment
     oldname oldmag  ->      subname submag  % comment
     oldname         ->      subname         % comment

Examples are:

     % These provide replacements for some LaTeX invisible fonts:
     iamr10 1500     ->      amr10 1500      % comment
     iamr10.1500     ->      amr10.1500      % comment
     iamssb8         ->      amssb8          % comment

The first two forms request substitution of a particular font and
magnification.  The third form substitutes an entire font family;
the closest available magnification to the required one will be
used.  Any dots in the non-comment portion will be converted to
spaces, and therefore, cannot be part of a name field.

The first matching substitution will be selected, so
magnification-specific substitutions should be given first,
before family substitutions.

Comments are introduced by percent and continue to end-of-line,
just as for TeX.  One whitespace character is equivalent to
any amount of whitespace.  Whitespace and comments are optional.

SCREEN CONTROL
==============


At present, DVIBIT is the only family member which supports
interactive viewing of the TeX output.  The following
description therefore applies only to it, but the functionality
should be adhered to in any new interactive device drivers.

All switches, including the page selection (`-o') and page
origin (-x and -y) switches, work normally.  In order to
avoid unnecessary waste of screen space, you probably will want
to specify -x0in and -y0in to remove the default one-inch
left and top margins.  The -q option is probably also
advisable to avoid warning messages, such as from font
substitutions.

At beginning of page, a command and status menu is displayed at
the top of the screen.  When the end-of-page command is reached
in the DVI file, or as soon as keyboard input is available, the
driver will enter the end-of-page routine.  Any keyboard input
command is then read and acted upon; unrecognized input is
discarded with a warning beep.  The advantage of checking for
keyboard input during the main DVI reading loop is that unwanted
display can be avoided.  This is valuable if you are
repositioning the page, or skimming a document.  The EMACS text
editor uses much the same display algorithm---do nothing more to
the screen if a user command will probably invalidate it anyway.

The input can select

   * redisplay of the current page, possibly shifting it up,
     down, left, or right, to see more of it, or to restore a
     display trashed by an unexpected system message or
     transmission line error;
   * continuation to the next page in the page list selected
     by default or by the -o option;
   * backing up to the previous page (useful if you overshoot);
   * display of an arbitrary page by typing its sequence number;
   * termination of execution.

Although the menu on the top line displays only a subset of the
possible commands, a number of synonyms are provided for user
convenience.  In particular, arrow keys in VT52 and VT100 modes
are recognized, as are EMACS control-character commands to move
the cursor or page display.  Commands are provided for both
coarse and fine adjustment of page position.

Here is the current command list.  Input is immediate; no
terminating carriage return is necessary.  Consequently, typing
error correction is supported only for the digit string command;
it ends at the first non-digit typed.

D     
     Move the display down by 1/8 of screen size.
     
U     
     Move the display up by 1/8 of screen size.
     
L     
     Move the display left by 1/8 of screen size.
     
R     
     Move the display right by 1/8 of screen size.
     
d or Ctl-N or down-arrow     
     Move the display down by 1/64 of screen size.
     
u or Ctl-P or up-arrow     
     Move the display up by 1/64 of screen size.
     
l or Ctl-B or left-arrow     
     Move the display left by 1/64 of screen size.
     
r or Ctl-F or right-arrow     
     Move the display right by 1/64 of screen size.
     
. or Ctl-L     
     Redisplay current page.
     
@     
     Redisplay current page with startup page positioning.
     
CARET or BACKSPACE     
     Redisplay previous page.
     
nnn     
     nnn is a digit string; DELETE/RUBOUT and BACKSPACE keys
     correct typing errors in it.  Move to nnn-th page, where
     document pages are numbered 1, 2, ....  The TeX page numbers
     are displayed in the status window. This is a recursive
     display; if you respond at end-of-page with a next-page
     command, display will revert to the page sequence you were
     viewing when you first issued the nnn command.
     
SPACE or RETURN or Ctl-V     
     Display next page.
     
Q or q or X or x     
     Quit or exit.  The screen will be cleared and the terminal
     restored to its normal font and emulation mode.
     
Z     
     Zoom up one magstep (1.2 times larger) from current size.
     
z     
     Zoom down one magstep (1.2 times smaller) from current size.
     
     It is likely that some font magnifications will be
     unavailable for zooming, so do not be alarmed if some
     characters are displayed as blanks when you do this.  You
     can use the font substitution mechanism (-f option above) to
     work around this, or you can ask your font administrator to
     generate the required magnifications.  When font
     substitution happens because of an unavailable
     magnification, characters of an incorrect size are used with
     the spacing required for the font which TeX used, so output
     is likely to look peculiar.
     
     To avoid exhausting the terminal's font memory, larger
     characters as sent as raster bitmaps each time they are
     used, rather than as downloaded fonts, making the screen
     display much slower.  The size limit is large enough that
     this should not be necessary except at large magnifications.

SPECIALS
========


The TeX `\special{}' command is intended to allow the
specification in a `.tex' file of a request to the DVI
driver, usually for the insertion of graphical material at that
point in the document.  It is currently implemented only for
DVIALW; other drivers will simply issue a warning message.

The TeX `\special{}' command is expected to look like one
of the following:

     \special{overlay filename}          % absolute positioning
     \special{include filename}          % relative positioning
     \special{insert filename}           % relative positioning

In the first case, the PostScript file to be included will be
mapped onto the page at precisely the coordinates it specifies.
In the other two cases, the upper-left corner of the bounding box
will be placed at the current point.  The PostScript file must
then contain (usually near the start) a comment of the form

     %%BoundingBox: llx lly urx ury

specifying the bounding  box lower-left and upper-right
coordinates in standard PostScript units (1/72 inch).
Alternatively, if the comment

     %%BoundingBox: (atend)

is found in the file,   the last 1000 characters of the file will
be searched to find a comment of the form:

     %%BoundingBox: llx lly urx ury

If the PostScript file cannot be opened, or the `\special{}'
command string cannot be recognized, or for relative positioning,
the bounding box cannot be determined, a warning message is
issued and the `\special{}' command is ignored.

Otherwise, the section of the PostScript file between the
comment lines

     %begin(plot)
     %end(plot)

is copied to the output file surrounded by

     save
     300 72 div 300 72 div scale % revert to standard 1/72 inch units
     % if relative positioning, then
     (xcp(in 1/72in)-llx) (ycp(in 1/72in)-ury) translate
     ...PostScript file contents...
     restore

Plot files produced by PLOT79 have all the expected commands in
them to allow their use in TeX `\special{}' commands.
The two PLOT79 parameters which influence the size of the plot
are

   * the device size specified in the call to SETSZ(); it
     defaults to 11in if SETSZ is not called.
   * the device space specified in the call to SETDS2() or
     SETDS3(); it defaults in the CORE system to the unit square,
     but if the PLOT79 framing routines are called, they will
     reset the device space to a horizontal or vertical frame in
     proportions of the local standard paper size (1 : 8.5/11 in
     the USA).

For example, if a device size of 5in is specified for a standard
horizontal frame, the bounding box will be declared to be 5in
wide and (8.5/11) * 5in = 3.8636in high, so a TeX manuscript
requiring the plot could have the following commands at the start
of a new paragraph:

     \special{include plotfilename}
     \vspace*{3.9in}

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
=====================


The behavior of the DVI translators can be influenced by
definition of logical names on TOPS-20 and VAX VMS, or
environment variables in Unix and PC-DOS.  Compiled-in internal
defaults will be provided for any of these which are not defined.
They must be entirely in upper-case, since that is conventional
on Unix systems.  The names currently recognized are as follows:

DVIHELP     
     This variable defines an alternate help string which is
     typed when the user makes an input error.  It should direct
     the user to additional documentation.  For example, on
     TOPS-20, it might be `try HELP DVI or XINFO DVI'.
     
FONTLIST     
     Normally, the drivers are prepared to search first for
     `.pk', then `.gf', then `.pxl' font files.  This variable
     can be used to change this search order, or remove one or
     more of the possibilities.  It is expected to contain at
     least one of the strings `PK', `GF', or `PXL', possibly
     separated by arbitrary punctuation and other text.  This
     flexibility is necessary because some operating systems
     expect environment variables to conform to some syntax, such
     as that of a file name.  Letter case is not significant.
     Some acceptable strings are `PXL-then-PK-then-GF', `pk.gf',
     `use-only-PXL-fonts', and `PXL/GF/PK'.
     
TERM     
     This variable is used only for DVIBIT; if it does not
     evaluate to either bitgraph or bg, DVIBIT will refuse to
     run.  On Unix, this is the conventional way of defining
     terminal types with the TERMCAP or TERMINFO systems.  This
     variable is ignored on VAX VMS, since the VMS C library sets
     it to a value which can never be bitgraph or bg.
     
TEXFONTS     
     This defines the directory path for finding font files.  Its
     value is prepended to the name of a TeX font to get a full
     file specification.  A typical value in Unix for `TEXFONTS'
     would be `/usr/local/lib/tex/fonts/'.  On TOPS-20, font
     cmr10 on a 300-dot/inch device might correspond to the files
     `texfonts:cmr10.300gf', `texfonts:cmr10.300pk', or
     `texfonts:cmr10.1500pxl'.
     
TEXINPUTS     
     This defines the directory path for finding files which are
     not in the current working directory.  It is prepended to
     file names.  A typical value in Unix would be
     /usr/local/lib/tex/macros/.

IBM PC Caveats
==============

The latest version of the drivers has been compiled with
Microsoft C Version 4.0.  With Version 3.0, some `.dvi'
files experienced a fatal "floating-point stack overflow"
error both with and without a floating-point coprocessor; this
can only be due to code generation errors, and it disappeared
with Version 4.0.

PC-DOS by default has only a small number of available open
files, and this number is not adequate for the drivers with the
value of five for MAXOPEN set in `machdefs.h'.  You
need to increase the limits by entering the lines

     FILES=10
     BUFFERS=10

in the `config.sys' file in the boot directory, then reboot
the system to have the new values take effect.  Larger values are
of course possible, though FILES=20 is the limit with current
versions of PC-DOS.   Run-time performance can be quite
sensitive to these settings, so you may wish to experiment.

If there is no `config.sys' file, or the settings of
FILES and BUFFERS are too small, you will find the disk
whirring madly while the driver attempts to open font files with
neighboring magnifications, and then it will finally die with a
message "unable to open .err file".  Use of the -d24
option may be useful in tracking how many files can successfully
be opened.

The drivers have been loaded with the default Microsoft
floating-point library; the compiler generates calls to library
routines which test a flag initialized at startup time which
indicates the presence or absence of the floating-point
coprocessor chip.  If it is available, the library routines will
automatically use it.  You can force the chip to be ignored by
defining an arbitrary non-empty string value for the environment
variable `NO87', for example

     set NO87=no-8087-available

When the DVI translator runs, the value of this variable should
be typed on the screen as the first output line.  On a Leading
Edge PC, this typeout does not appear, for unknown reasons.  On
a 4.77MHz PC XT, the translators run twice (!) as slowly when
`NO87' is defined.

The reason that you might need to know this is that the method
employed by the library routines for detecting the presence or
absence of an 8087 (or 80287) chip is not infallible, thanks to
design flaws of some PC's and possibly also the Intel chips.  It
is conceivable that the library might think a coprocessor chip is
present, when in fact it is not, and the first floating-point
instruction executed would hang the machine.

AUTHORS
=======


David Fuchs at Stanford University wrote DVITYPE in `web' and
defined the DVI file format.

Mark Senn at Purdue University wrote a preliminary version of the
BBN BitGraph driver in C, using DVITYPE as a model.

Stephan v. Bechtolsheim and Bob Brown at Purdue, Robert Wells
at BBN, and Jim Schaad and Richard Furuta at the University of
Washington, improved it.

Contributions for PostScript devices came from Neal Holtz at
Carleton University.  Simon Barnes of Schlumberger Cambridge
Research Ltd., and Robin Rohlicek at BBN provided useful
additions to the BBN BitGraph driver which have been generalized
and incorporated in Version 2.07.

The transformation to about a dozen other device drivers, the
massive code rearrangement for many new features as well as easy
identification of host- and device-dependent sections, plus
support for `.pk' and `.gf' compact font files, was carried out
at the University of Utah by Nelson H.F.  Beebe.  He also wrote
the documents A TeX DVI Driver Family and Using LaTeX at the
University of Utah College of Science DEC-20.  The first
describes all of these drivers in detail, and the second is the
Local LaTeX Guide.

Lon Willett at Utah adapted DVIJEP to make DVIIMP for the Imagen
laser printer family.

John Sauter adapted one of the low-resolution printer drivers to
produce DVIL75 for the DEC LA75 printer, and DVIL3P for the DEC
LN03 Plus laser printer.

Norman Naugle and colleagues at Texas A&M implemented the
family on several new systems.
