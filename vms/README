The file `emacs.com' in this directory is for VMS.  It defines logical
names and commands such as `emacs', so you must edit it to specify the
file and directory names used on your machine.  This file must be
executed in each session to enable you to run the installed Emacs.  It
should be executed by your `login.com' file, or else perhaps it can be
executed once at system boot time.

The file `kepteditor.com' in this directory is also for VMS.  When a
user says to run Emacs, it really runs this command file.

See the files VMSINSTALL, VMSNOTES, and VMSBUILD for more information
on VMS use.
