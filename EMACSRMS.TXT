Nobody has any reason to be afraid to use or distribute GNU
Emacs.

It is well known that I do not believe any software is
anyone's property.  However, for the GNU project, I decided
it was necessary to obey the law.  I have refused to look
at code I did not have permission to distribute.

About 5% of GNU Emacs is close to (though quite a bit
changed from) an old version of Gosling Emacs.  I am
distributing it for Fen Labalme, who received permission
from Gosling to distribute it.  It is therefore legal for me
to do so.  To be scrupulously legal, I put statements at the
front of the files concerned, describing this situation.

I don't see anything I should warn people about--except that
Zimmerman is going to try to browbeat them.

I want to emphasize I am  not telling people  to stop using  gnu emacs
because of rumored legal hassles.  I mean the sources  of these rumors
should either come   up with something  concrete  to  back  up   their
statements or they should shut up.  Until then we will continue to use
gnu emacs.

I should also like  to point out that  having  looked at the internals
of Montgomery Emacs  (from ATT),  CCA Emacs, Unipress (Gosling)  Emacs
and Gnu Emacs.  CCA Emacs is a lot more like ATT  Emacs than Gnu Emacs
is like  Unipress Emacs.  An example of  this  both Montgomery and CCA
emacs handle glob (*) via a backgroup shell process  to which emacs is
writing and from  which emacs is  reading.  Actually, since  Gnu Emacs
contains  a full implementation of   Lisp  (unlike  Gosling Emacs),  I
would say that conceptually Gnu Emacs is more similar to Prime Emacs.

Not to mention the fact that there are only 6 or 7 files that have
Gosling's name in them (for which RMS has permission to distribute)
and if you run diff on Gnu and Unipress (or Gosling) sources the
output fills reams of screens.  I did this last night out of curiosity
after your messages; the differences are significantly more than cosmetic.

Anyone who had to ever go to another terminal to kill a Unipress emacs
because the mucklisp ran rampant would know why `the sources of these
rumors' are muttering about the best software system I have ever seen
under Unix (a trademark of some giganto conglomerate whose name I have
forgotten).

I expected some flames in reply to my mesage, and I must say, I'm not
disappointed.

I think it's time for me to clear up some misinformation about CCA EMACS
being spread on the net, largely by Yakim Martillo.  Since its release
as a product, CCA EMACS has contained no code from Montgomery's EMACS.
Early, free versions of CCA EMACS contained some of Montgomery's code
(which was being freely distributed by other means and which had no
indication in the sources that it was in any way proprietary).  When CCA
decided to sell EMACS as a product, it made inquiries at Bell Labs to
make sure that they did not consider it proprietary.  Bell Labs took
several months studying the issue, during which time they discovered the
widespread distribution of Montgomery's EMACS, and the fact that they
had apparently not taken the necessary care to protect this code as
demanded by trade secret law.  Nevertheless, they informed CCA that they
still considered the code to be proprietary, and CCA offered to remove
Montgomery's code.  Bell Labs accepted the offer, and the issue has been
closed since then.  There is also no evidence that Bell Labs was
"unhappy" with either me or CCA; their correspondence with us always
mentioned our productive past relationship, thanked us for cooperating
fully with them and for our understanding of the matter, etc.  In
general, they seemed to be grateful that we took the time to check this
situation out with them, and that we did not contest their claim of the
proprietariness of Montgomery's code.

> An example of  this  both Montgomery and CCA
> emacs handle glob (*) via a backgroup shell process  to which emacs is
> writing and from  which emacs is  reading.  

This statement is patently false.  There was no background shell
process, no "glob" routine, nor anything else performing the same or
similar functions in the version of Montgomery's EMACS (4.0) that I once
used, which always ran as a single process and which is the only version
I ever saw.  These features were all completely original with me.
Similarly, the statement about all the file names being the same is also
false.  For one thing, Montgomery's EMACS 4.0 had around twelve source
files, while mine has had over sixty for several years.  Now, it is
known that my original hybrid of my EMACS and Montgomery's made its way
to many Bell Labs sites.  It appears that Mr. Martillo saw some of this
code and thought it was Montgomery's, not realizing that much of it was
mine.  As it is, Mr. Martillo notes that he never saw a pure version of
Montgomery's Emacs.

On another note, RMS says that he got permission from Fen Labalme to
distribute Gosling's Emacs (or portions thereof).  When I was at
Usenix, I talked to Unipress, and this is what RMS told them as well.
However, according to Unipress, Labalme has no right to distribute
Gosling's Emacs, and when RMS was confronted with this, he was unable to
produce any written permission from either Gosling or Unipress.

When I talked with Unipress, they felt that Gosling was clearly in
violation of the law.  (Note that copyright law covers "derivative
works" as well as original source.)  However, with GNU Emacs already
distributed all over the place, they seemed to feel that trying to step
in at this late date would probably be counterproductive.  So, I gather
that they will not press this issue.  However, I would hope that RMS is
more careful when it comes to the writing of GNU itself.

As for "browbeating" people, what does RMS think I am suggesting?  That
everyone throw away their copy of GNU Emacs and forget that it ever
existed?  Not at all.  It's simply that I'm sure that the creator of the
original EMACS is intelligent enough to write an entire UNIX Emacs
himself; under the circumstances, I hope he would do the honorable thing
and rewrite from scratch those portions of GNU Emacs derived from
Gosling's code.  If he does not, I think a cloud will hang over the GNU
project for some time to come.

Fen Labalme got permission from Gosling in a message several years ago.
I'm told that this is legally binding on Gosling.
This was before Unipress was involved in distributing Gosling Emacs
and therefore Unipress has no direct knowledge about the question.

Megatest uses that old Gosling Emacs (what Fen gave me originally) in
its IC test systems.  Fen says that Megatest's lawyers tell him they
can defend his permission in court if it were necessary.

However, we don't expect it to be necessary.  We don't think Unipress
wants to sue anyone.  It would be a shame if people refrain from using
GNU Emacs because of a hypothetical suit that would not win and that
won't happen.

It's a shame that it is so hard to PROVE that someone won't
sue someone else.  However, we are working on it.

I've tried to stay out of this discussion, but it has gotten too far
out of hand for me to remain silent.  In no way did I ever give Fen
Lebalm (and by dubious transitivity, Richard Stallman) permission to
distribute any part of the Emacs that I wrote.  Version 85 was not in
the public domain - I was very careful to get everyone who recieved a
copy to agree to not redistribute it.  Unfortunatly, two moves have
left my records in a shambles.

I am not against public domain software: I am very much in favor of
it.  There is an awful lot of public domain software floating around on
the net that was written by me.  Emacs is not a part of it.

I would applaud the GNU effort (Emacs has needed a real lisp in it for
a long time) if it hadn't started off with what is at best a dreadful
misunderstanding.

Properly maintaining a piece of software like Emacs over a long period
is hard to do on a volunteer basis.  I did it with my version for three
years and nearly destroyed my chances to graduate.  I spent a long time
trying to find a new maintainer (either commercial or public domain).
I found no one willing to maintain it in the public domain and provide
the quality and the commitment that I thought was necessary.  I talked
with quite a few companies, and by far the best was Unipress.  They may
prostitute their souls for a dollar, but they do a pretty good job of
looking after Emacs.

Summary: 

The discussion about various permits to distribute Unix based
software brought to my mind the days when I filled applications for
educational licenses for Unix Versions 6 and 7.  I still clearly
remember that in order to get such a license I had to state in the
application that the machine will be used for teaching and research
purposes only and that the results of the research (including the
code) had to be made publicly available.  The impression I got was
that development of commercial software and an educational license
don't mix and that if we were ever going to sell any of our code, the
very first line of it had to be written on a purely commercial
machine.

Have the things changed since those days?  Is it now ok to charge
more than a handling fee or to sumbit the software to a commercial
distributor such as Unipress in order to add value to it?  If not, I
would like to know how many purely commercial 4.x Unix systems CMU
had when James wrote his Emacs and which one he used; or maybe he
really did all the development in a company down the street?  What
about Amsterdam Compiler Kit, another product of Unipress whose early
versions were distributed for a nominal cost by EUUG?

I have nothing againsts James or the folks at Amsterdam and I very
well understand their motives in submitting the whole thing to a
company that frees them from the hassle and maybe even improves the
product.  But IF the software was developed on a machine with an
educational Unix license, can the company be nothing else than a
distributor of public domain software?  (Henry, are you listening
this group?)

Summary: 

This is followup to my own message where I questioned the use of an
educational Unix license for commercial purposes.  Below are some
relevant quotes from the terms for System V:

1.01 (a) Uses for "academic and educational purposes" means uses
directly related to teaching ... and uses in noncommercial research
by students and faculty, ..., provided that (i) neither the results
of such research nor any enhancement or modification so developed is
intended primarily for the benefit of a third party, (ii) such
results, enhancements and modifications (...) are made available to
anyone (...) without restriction on use, copying, or further
distribution, notwithstanding any proprietary right (such as a
copyright or patent right) that could be asserted by LICENSEE, its
students or faculty members and (iii) any copy of such result,
enhancement or modification furnished by LICENSEE is furnished for no
more than the cost of reproduction and shipping.

(b) Commercial use by LICENSEE of the LICENSED SOFTWARE or of any
such result, enhancement or modification is not permitted under this
agreement.  Such commercial use is permissible only pursuant to the
terms of an appropriate commercial software agreement between AT&T
and LICENSEE.  Any such result, enhancement or modification may be
developed further by LICENSEE for commercial use (...) only on CPUs
covered by such commercial software agreement and only provided that
the result, enhancement or modification, in the form in which it
exists when such commercial software agreement is executed by
LICENSEE, remains available to anyone as specified in Section 1.01
(a).

So, the question remains, did the machine James (I am using him here
just as an example) developed his Emacs have a commercial Unix
license.  If it didn't, James' copyright notice doesn't prevent
anybody (including Richard) (re)distributing James' code in the
form it was when it left the educational machine.  The same, of
course, applies to any copyrighted code floating around in various
universities.  This is provided that the earlier licenses said
roughly the same thing.

Not true.  There are several different issues here.  Let's assume for
the moment that Gosling did develop his Emacs on a machine with an
educational license.  (James, is this true?)  First of all, according to
the copyright law, he has an automatic copyright on anything he
develops, assuming it wasn't done as work for hire, which it apparently
wasn't.  As part of that copyright, he has the right to put copyright
notices on all his code, which he promptly did.  Neither of these steps
are in violation of the System V license; Berkeley did essentially the
same thing when it put all of its "Copyright 198? Regents of the
University of California" legends on much of its software.

Now, if Gosling developed his software on a machine licensed under the
terms you quoted, the University would be required to share Gosling's
code free of charge with others.  Whether or not it could compel Gosling
to do so would depend on what agreements Gosling had made with the
University.  In any case, Gosling's refusal to give unlimited
distribution to his code would be at most a violation of a civil
contract, and would therefore be a matter between him, the University,
and AT&T.  It would not affect the copyright protection granted to him
by federal law.  That is, other people might try to convince AT&T to
force CMU and/or Gosling to distribute his code, but if AT&T didn't want
to do that, Gosling's copyright protection would stand.  For example,
AT&T might decide that since the educational license terms had been
violated, it would force CMU to upgrade the license to a commercial one,
and not bother Gosling.  Regardless of what course of action AT&T took,
someone who copied Gosling's code without his permission would be in
violation of federal copyright law, even if Gosling and/or CMU were
found to be in violation of the AT&T license.

This is all from a legal standpoint, of course; I have not addressed the
moral question here.  Unfortunately, moral arguments usually don't get
you very far in court if you get sued.

My background in all of this is that during the development of my EMACS,
I had occasion to study the entire copyright law quite carefully, and I
also at one point retained an attorney whose specialty was copyright and
trade secret protection, and who had represented clients such as Data
General.  However, I am not a lawyer myself, and therefore cannot
present any of this as definitive legal advice.  For that, people must
go to their own lawyers.

On a related note, I recently received some mail from someone who did go
to the trouble of checking with his company's lawyer about GNU Emacs.  I
thought that people reading this newsgroup would be interested in what the
lawyer said.  The person sending me the message indicated that he didn't
want to get in the middle of this whole thing, so I've changed the names
to protect the innocent.  Here's the relevant part of his message:

        I actually did talk to our lawyer in charge of licensing and
        associated software stuff about GNU, described the situation and
        asked him what his opinion was. That was that we probably didn't
        want to touch it with a 10 foot pole. Unless RMS can come up
        with something that is legally binding (and electronic mail,
        which is easily forgeable, doesn't count) he won't let us add
        GNU to our [line of software] unless we can get a release from
        Gosling allowing us to. He doesn't buy the third hand
        redistribution, especially in light of [Gosling's] statements,
        and doesn't want us to expose ourselves to liability by
        distributing further. He more or less thinks that RMS is all
        wet.

I can't understand how honor could require me to replace any
of the code I am distributing in GNU Emacs.

Using the modified Gosling display code in GNU Emacs is
not immoral.  Redistributing any code is always morally good.

It's not disobeying the spirit of the law.  (We know
we really do have permission.)

It's not disobeying the letter of the law.  (That is, we expect
we could win if we were sued.  That's the most anyone can ever say.)

It's not breaking any promise Fen or I made.

Where is the dishonor?

Here is why I don't want to rewrite the display code:

Any display code would have a considerable resemblance to that display
code, just by virtue of doing the same job.

Without any clear idea of exactly how much difference there would have
to be to reassure you users, I cannot tell whether the rewrite would
accomplish that.  The law is not any guidance here.  Just because something
is legal doesn't mean you won't be scared--if you are scared now.

Writing display code that is significantly different is not easy.
I don't want to do that much work which is not really necessary,
just to reassure someone, when I can't be sure it will even do that.

The real problem is not a legal one; it is that some of you might be
intimidated.  You are the only ones who stand to lose anything.
Perhaps some of you would like to write a replacement for the display
code?  You are the best one to know what it takes to reassure you.

There is another point in favor of this.  It is that the people who
think a certain piece of work is necessary are the ones who ought to
get it done.  Remember, I have written GNU Emacs as a volunteer,
trying to serve the public.  Many people like it, but some don't.  If
you aren't satisfied with it, you can't blame me for that.  I did a lot
for you just taking it as far as I have.  If you want something that
I have not done, you should take some responsibility and do it.

Zimmerman, are you interested?

Clearly, you and I have differing conceptions of "honor" and what is
"morally good".  I seriously doubt that either of us is going to convince
the other, though, so let's leave it at that and not burn up any more
phone bills over the issue.

I can only say that it appears that you have not received any competent
legal advice.  First of all, your record is pretty poor, since Mark
Linton (the author of dbx) has publicly denied statements you attributed
to him, and James Gosling has likewise publicly denied that he took the
actions that you say he did.  However, let's even assume for the moment
that your account is correct, and that Gosling sent some message to Fen
Labalme that he later forgot, saying something like the following.

        You have my permission to make copies of Emacs #85 for whomever
        you want, whenever you want, without limitation.  Furthermore,
        this permission can never be revoked.

Even such a statement from Gosling to Labalme would not help your case
at all.  For although it would give Labalme permission to make copies,
it does not transfer that permission to anyone else.  The presence of
the copyright notice at the top of each module reserves the right of
copy to the author and to those to whom he has explicitly granted
permission.  The fact the a publisher may have permission to make copies
of a book does not mean that people who buy those copies or receive them
for free have any right to copy them.  This would be the same type of
situation.  In order for you to have the right to distribute GNU Emacs
in the manner in which you have, you would have to have had something
like the following attached to the previous statement:

        Furthermore, you may grant permission to copy these files to
        anyone else, and they may in turn grant such permission to
        anyone else, and so on, ad infinitum.

This would be tantamount to removing the copyright notices (a recourse
available only to the author), which would be a much simpler procedure.
Such a statemtent would be completely contrary to all of Gosling's
public statements, as well as his public actions; he has taken great
care throughout the years to keep his Emacs from falling into the public
domain.

But you keep mentioning this message to Labalme without producing it;
once again, why don't you post this message to the net so that we can
all see what permission was or was not granted to Labalme?  (Of course,
verifying the authenticity of the message would be another interesting
task, and should not be taken for granted.

This is irrelevant.  Copyright law has nothing to do with people making
promises.

This is all nonsense, and I speak as someone who has had a fair amount
of experience in this area.  When CCA decided to rewrite Montgomery's
display code in CCA EMACS, I was working under the restriction that none
of the same algorithms could even be used.  Montgomery's code was quite
reasonable, but there were some fundamental limitations in his
algorithms.  I designed a new display manager from the ground up that
bore no resemblance to his, and that had none of the limitations that
his did.  (I understand that Montgomery later did a major revision of
his display code himself, so his current version went off in yet another
direction.)  My display manager now looks no more like Montgomery's than
EMACS looks like vi.  (Both edit text, remember.)  The whole project
took me three weeks, and that was while I also had responsibility for
maintaining CCA's two VAXes.

You, on the other hand, would be working under less stringent
restrictions.  Since copyright law doesn't protect algorithms, you could
even use Gosling's algorithms if you really wanted, as long as the new
code wasn't derived from the old.  Of course, the difference would
probably be more clearcut if you used different algorithms.  The display
code in Emacs #85 is certainly not the ultimate in a display manager;
one of its features was that certain changes in the display caused the
CPU time required to update the display to grow quadratically with the
number of lines affected.  I'm sure you could do better than that with
different algorithms; several other people have.

> The real problem is not a legal one; it is that some of you might be
> intimidated.

There is a very real legal problem here.  Unless both James Gosling and
Mark Linton are lying, and unless you can produce and authenticate a
message to Labalme from Gosling effecting renouncing Gosling's
copyright, then you have violated the law with respect to both Emacs and
dbx and have encouraged others to do the same.

> You are the only ones who stand to lose anything.

This is quite true.  It would be hard for anyone to win much of a
judgement against you personally, since I assume you are not rich.
However, a real liability is created for others on this net and for
their companies.  Lotus and others have established by precedent that
companies are liable for illegal duplication of software by their
employees even if the companies were not directly aware of their
employees' activities.  Now, Unipress has indicated that it is not
inclined to sue at this point.  However, If AT&T sees parts of UNIX
gradually being put into the public domain, it may feel forced to move
its legions of attorneys into action.  To dismiss this possibility out
of hand would be foolish.

No, thanks.  I'm quite happy with my own EMACS.  GNU Emacs is your
project.

Originally posted on June 24, but the Megatest Mailer Monster ate it...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
I would like to try to shed some light on what has become the great
GNU EMACS copyright debate.

As many of you may know, Richard Stallman originally wrote EMACS
around 1974.  He did not charge for distributions.  Rather, he
insisted that users "join the EMACS software-sharing commune."
EMACS was used extensively throughout the MIT and ARPA communities.
Many similar editors exist:  SINE, FINE, EINE, ZWEI, etc.

While working on his thesis at CMU, Jim Gosling began work on FRED.
Borrowing some ideas from Mike Kazar's FINE editor (notably the
keymapping paradigm) he re-wrote the code to produce the first UNIX
EMACS circa 1980.  I received one of these early versions in 1981,
and later, version #85 in May of 1982.

I (and others) made many modifications to EMACS along the way.  Most
of these got sent back to JAG@CMU for incorporation into future rel-
eases.  As I had personal contact with several sites in California
(decwrl, sun, ucb, Shasta, and others) I asked Jim if I could distribute
my modifications directly.  He granted me such permission in an informal
(email) note.  This note said that I could make releases, provided that
I provided to each site a complete copy of his original code.  My
changes were to be released separately.  As it happened, my release
tapes contained two files:  my version first followed by Jim's original
version.

On January 3, 1985, Fred Pack of UniPress contacted me, asking if I had
permission to distribute EMACS and what the current state of my work was.
I have since spent some time looking for the note that I received from
Jim Gosling.  As it is somewhere on a three year old dump tape, and we
have a very large distributed system, I have not found it easy to locate.
I am still looking for the note.

On April 22, I talked to Jim about the matter.  He remembered having given
different distribution permissions to different people, but didn't recall
what exactly he might have granted to me.  He also stated that the real
reason behind the copyright notice was to keep others from profiting from
his work. It is inexplicable why Gosling's current statements differ from
what he said to me.

The spirit of the original UNIX distributions was very similar to that of
Richard Stallman's.  In fact, to quote frome Jim Gosling's "Unix Emacs"
manual, dated May 1982: "Calling this editor EMACS is rather presumptious
and even dangerous.... Unix Emacs was called EMACS in the hope that cries
of outrage would be enough to goad the author and others to bring it up
to the standards of what has come before."  Now that we have done so
(with GNU EMACS) I am surprised and dismayed that the loudest objections
come from the author of this statement.

As one of the "others" who helped to bring EMACS up to speed, I was
distressed when Jim sold the editor to UniPress.  This seemed to be
a direct violation of the trust that I and others had placed in
Jim as we sent him our improvements, modifications, and bug fixes.
I am especially bothered by the general mercenary attitude surrounding
EMACS which has taken over from the once proud "hacker" ethic -- EMACS is
a tool that can make all of our lives better.  Let's help it to grow!

I have been striving to treat UniPress fairly.  I have
been in communication with them for the last 6 months, and have sent them
2 letters, neither of which have been answered to date.  Instead, what I
have gotten is a series of aspersions against me and the GNU project
posted publicly in net.emacs.  I feel that I have treated the parties
involved honorably and have remained well within the bounds of the law at
all times.  I am currently awaiting a response from UniPress regarding an
agreement that I sent to them several weeks ago.  I will gladly keep the
net informed as to developments regarding this matter.

I was going to wait for Fen's message before saying more on the issue,
but Fen's message ran into mailer troubles at Megatest.  It may be
on its way now, but I don't want to wait any longer.

I have decided to replace the Gosling code in GNU Emacs,
even though I still believe Fen and I have permission to
distribute that code, in order to keep people's confidence
in the GNU project.

I came to this decision when I found, this night, that I saw
how to rewrite the parts that had seemed hard.  I expect to
have the job done by the weekend.

Unfortunately, this will delay the the time you receive the GNU Emacs
manual.  I'm sure Unipress is happy to have accomplished that.

Software sharers are happy if you get good software.
Software-hoarding organizations such as Unipress and CCA are looking
for ways they can restrict you, because each restriction they can
manage to impose means more pressure on you to pay them.  If there
is an alternative to paying them, they want to close it off.

For example, just by looking at Zimmerman's messages, you can see
that his goal is to convince you of the most restrictive interpretation
of the law at every juncture--to get you to forfeit as much as possible.
Gosling says he supports free software--yet he was clearly making
preparations to sell Gosling Emacs even while urging the community
to contribute.

This is the kind of attitude that people develop when they make a
habit of profiting from interfering with other people.

In the long run, you are better off encouraging the growth of organizations
that want to give you software, and not feeding companies Unipress or CCA
that really just want to take as much as possible from you.

I challenge you to find an attorney who has a "less restrictive"
interpretation of the law in this case.  This just happens to be the way
the law is interpreted by the courts.

In an earlier message, I urged you to rewrite those portions of GNU
Emacs containing Gosling's code.  Now that you are doing so, I am quite
satisfied, and once this is finished, I can see no legal reason for
someone not to use GNU Emacs.  I fail to see how I have profited from
this.  To the contrary, it seems to be your users who have profited, for
they will soon be able to use GNU Emacs without doubts as to its legal
status.  Since UniPress apparently helped you come to your decision, I
cannot see why they should be condemned.  I think most of your users
would prefer to wait a little bit longer for the GNU Emacs manual in
order to have a product that is free from questions about its legality.

Unlike RMS I  am not driven  by ideological fervor  to  take a   stand
against "software  hoarding."  I  was willing  to  "prostitute" myself
and work for ATT Bell  Laboratories.   But I learned  Unix in the days
when the government  forbade  ATT  to sell  Unix  as  a product.   The
material which came out  of the Computer Research  Group then was much
more interesting  than the substandard Unix called  5V2.  The computer
research software was interesting because  the research group was able
to give and receive  ideas from  the  university environment.  Now ATT
is    so paranoic about  protecting  "trade   secrets"  that they  NIH
(NDH)'ed almost every interesting idea in the system.

Xerox's  paranoia basically kept  almost everyone  from learning about
some of  the interesting new    computer   ideas developed  in   their
research  environment and  in   the end this  paranoic concealment  of
ideas is harming Xerox.

RMS  could  easily  be correct that the current   system of industrial
software development hinders  both  research and  harms business.  The
justification that  someone must pay for the   development environment
is   incorrect because hardware  is   worthless without good software.
Therefore the  hardware manufactures have an interest  in  seeing good
new software freely available.

The current  situation  needs people  to  take strong  stands  against
ridiculously rigid interpretations of copyright laws.  If I compose  a
piece  of  written   material, the  convention  is   I  can use  three
consecutive  words from  someone  else's writings  unattributed.    In
scholarly literature, properly  attributed   quotation  is  considered
acceptable up to  about 20% of the composition.   A ridiculously rigid
interpretation of the copyright laws  could  easily require an  author
to get  permission   for  every single  quote,  but this is  silly and
everyone  knows it.  Software  copyright  law is  still relatively new
and no one knows the  commonsense measure.   This  lack of commonsense
measure is being used to scare people.

I would suggest  1 pages of  unattributed code (of  generic  functions
like  strcpy) in a  software  project of at   least moderate  size  is
acceptable.   In  a similar  project, complaining about   10%  or less
attributed code is  silly.   Now the disputed modules   in   Gnu Emacs
constitue about 5% of the  code and I  suspect  less than 10%  of  the
original  version of Gosling's emacs.    Further of the  modules which
contain Gosling's copyright,  Trm.h (a 3  page module)  has  about 50%
(by line  excluding comments) of  its code in common with  the current
version of  Unipress   Emacs.   The difference   between   the current
version of Unipress Emacs and  Gnu Emacs dsp.c (a   5 page module)  is
90%.  The differences between  current version of  Unipress  Emacs and
Gnu Emacs display.c  (a  19 page  module) is about   80%. For all  the
modules which Fen LeBalme gave RMS permission to  use, the differences
are  similar.  Unipress   is not  even using  the   disputed  software
anymore!  Now, these modules contain code people like  Chris Torek and
others contributed when Gosling's emacs  was  in the public domain.  I
must  wonder  whether  these  people would  have  contributed had they
known their freely-given  code was going to become   part of someone's
product.

The  use  of   this freely-given  code   in  the product seems  rather
questionable if this code does not remain freely  available for others
to use even despite the copyright notice.   Trying to forbid  RMS from
using discarded code so that he must spend time to reinvent  the wheel
supports  his  contention that "software  hoarders"  are slowing  down
progress in computer science.

If using  the discarded code  is  wrong, I must wonder  why  display.c
(p. 10) contains the following notice.

[ Insert your favorit clever quote here. ]

Excerpt from: martillo@mit-athena.UUCP (Joaquim Martillo)
    <allegra!mit-eddie!mit-athena!martillo>

   Software copyright law is still relatively new and no one knows
   the commonsense measure.  This lack of commonsense measure is
   being used to scare people.

   I would suggest 1 pages of unattributed code (of generic functions
   like strcpy) in a software project of at least moderate size is
   acceptable.  In a similar project, complaining about 10% or less
   attributed code is silly.

A tangential point here which might be of interest.  When depositing
code with the Copyright Office, one is required only to submit:

"... one copy of identifying portions of the program ... 'identifying
portions' shall mean either the first and last 25 pages of the
program ... together with the page or equivalent unit containing the
copyright notice, if any."  [1]

Also, use of generic functions does not necessarily constitute copyright
violation or preclude copyrighting.  After submiting a work for
copyright, if the person submiting the forms has claimed exclusive
authorship, a form letter which basically asks:

[To what extent does the deposited program contain preexisting
materials?  Your application implies ...] "... that the program
is entirely new and contains no SUBSTANTIAL (my emphasis) amount of
material that has been previously registered or published or that
has become standard usage for certain purposes.  Although some
programmers crate from scratch all parts of their programs, we
understand that many draw from libraries or previously developed
programs or routines in creating a new program." [1]

A general comment: Many of the submissions "explaining" the law
regarding copyrights, patents, and trade secret which I see on
the net seem to have many misconceptions.  (I do not mean to
imply anything negative about the above excerpted article, as it
expresses wishes, rather than claims things are facts.)  It seems
to me that some of these people should do some reading before they
start writing.  Herewith, some suggestions:

[1] "A Software Law Primer", Frederic W. Neitzke, 1984, Van
    Nostrand Reinhold, page 52.

[2] "Law and the Computer", Michael C. Gemignani, 1981, CBI
    Publishing.

A quick quiz:  If I put:

/* great.c - Great C program
 * (C) 1984 by Michael Zaleski */

at the beginning of my great C program, have I preserved my
legal copyright rights?

The surprising answer is NO!  See page 50 of [1].

Although the second part of this statement is true, I think you're
making some false assumptions in the first part.  As supporting
evidence, you quote:

> [To what extent does the deposited program contain preexisting

This certainly corresponds to my understanding of the copyright law.
However, if you read it (and the copyright law itself) carefully, it is
clear that this is merely stating the eligibility requirements for
copyrighting a program.  That is, a program must be substantially
original in order to be eligible for copyright, but use of library
routines and similar programs (which may or may not be copyrighted) does
not necessarily detract from that originality.  I think a close reading
of these texts will show that they do not say that it is all right to
use copyrighted subroutines or similar code in a new program without
permission, and that the proper use of such code implies that permission
has been received.

I liked your example of the invalid copyright notice.  The problem, of
course, is that the international copyright symbol is a C with a circle
around it, and the parentheses don't quite qualify.  Adding the word
"Copyright" is sufficient protection under U.S. law.  However, this word
does not satisfy international copyright law, which accepts only the
circle C.  This leads to the interesting situation that there is no way
no put an internationally valid copyright notice into an ASCII source
file.

    organizations such as Unipress and CCA are looking for ways they can
    restrict you, because each restriction they can manage to impose means
    more pressure on you to pay them.   If there is an alternative to paying
    them, they want to close it off.  

Some people working on the Gnu project obviously feel that they are at odds
with UniPress, and that UniPress is doing everything in its power to damage
them.  If making UniPress be the bad guys, and imagining yourself to be
pitted against them for the good of all mankind, gives you the impetus you
need to write good software, it seems to have worked - Gnumacs is a
fantastic editor.   I suppose every cause needs a nemesis, but please
choose one that is really on the other side.

UniPress has no quarrel with the Gnu project.  It bothers me that people
seem to think we are trying to hinder it.  In fact, we hardly did or said
much at all, except to point out that the Gnumacs code had James Gosling's
copyright in it.  We have not done anything to keep anyone from using
Gnumacs, nor do we intend to now that it is "Gosling-free" (version
16.56).

You can consider this to be an official statement from UniPress:  There is
nothing in Gnumacs version 16.56 that could possibly cause UniPress to get
upset.  If you were afraid to use Gnumacs because you thought we would
hassle you, don't be, on the basis of version 16.56.  

Can we all please get back to our work now, and stop arguing about
copyright law???

Could we have a little applause, please, for Unipress for issuing
a direct, succinct statement about the status of Gosling-free Emacs.
They were under no particular legal or moral obligation to do so.

mg (who posted it, and maintains gosmacs) is a cool person, and
probably has a lot to do with keeping the corporate cretins at bay.
(At least as far as gnu is concerned)  So let's hear it for Mike at least.

However, I think that you will find that Unipress itself is as slimey as
any other corporation in the business --- don't let one good
impression spoil their image! =;-)

DISCLAIMER:

        The following does not represent anyone's opinion but my own.
It does not reflect the official stance of Harvard University.

FLAME:

        I guess mly's comments are more fallout from the great Gosling
code controversy, but I find them unhelpful and unconstructive.  Just
what does he mean by "slimy"?  Is he accusing Unipress of illegal or
immoral acts?  If he is, he had better either substantiate what he says
with hard facts, or not express such opinions in "print" (yes, this
arguably "printed material" you're reading).  Such remarks veer close
to libel.  GNU is not going to help its cause by indiscriminately
calling people or companies "slimy".

        These remarks have no bearing on what I think of GNUemacs or of
the GNU project as a whole.  GNUemacs is a fantastic editor, and the
cause of a public-domain UNIX is a noble one.  Let's not endanger that
cause with useless acrimony.

The Unipress-GNU controversey has already begun to recede into the back
of my mind, but I seem to recall  reports to the effect that Unipress
was considering some form of action against GNU.  Anyway, SOMEthing must
have prompted RMS to re-write the code.  If it was not Unipress, then it
must have been the volume of articles suggesting that there were grounds
for legal action.  While RMS' action was perhaps the best possible answer
to the controversey, it seems rather "slimy" to me that he was indeed forced
to do so.

Such unpalatable affairs are only useful in that they further illuminate
the worthy goals of the Freeware project.

RMS rewrote the display code because it was: "the best possible answer
to" the controversy.  It removed any possible doubts about the public
domainness of GNU Emacs.

Note that RMS still feels the Gosling display code is in the public
domain, and available for use.  It was just more important to have GNU
Emacs be free of any controversy and decisions to not use it because
of that controversy.

I hope we can lay this whole thing to bed, and get back to producing
good public-domain software.

Disclaimer:     ;-}

I am not speaking for RMS here, but am recounting what I know of the
reasons for the decision.  I am a member of the GNU project.
