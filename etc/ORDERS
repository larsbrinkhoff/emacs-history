Contents of CD-ROM, Deluxe Distribution, and Each Tape on the FSF Order Form
****************************************************************************

      PRICE AND CONTENTS MAY CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE AFTER January 31, 1994.

GNU Source Code CD-ROM

The 2nd edition of the GNU Source Code CD-ROM contains sources to the
distribution of the GNU Project including: Emacs 18 and 19, GCC, G++, GDB,
Bison, GAS, Make, GAWK, Texinfo, the GNU Utilities, RCS and CVS, f2c,
Ghostscript, tar, gnuplot, diff, and BASH, as well as the MIT X Window
System required components.

This CD includes everything on our Emacs, Languages, Utilities, Experimental,
and X11 Required tapes as of May 1993.	Note that the contents of the
BSD-Net2, X11 Optional and MIT Scheme tapes are not on the CD.

The CD also contains some packages ported to Intel 80386 and 80486-based
machines running MS-DOS: Demacs, DJGPP, and MIT Scheme.	 In addition, it
contains Mtools, which is a public domain collection of programs to allow Unix
systems to read, write, and manipulate files on an MS-DOS file system
(typically a diskette).

The CD is in ISO 9660 format with Rockridge extensions, and can be mounted as
a read-only file system on most operating systems.  You can build most of this
software without needing to copy the sources off the CD.  It requires only
enough free disk space for the object files and the intermediate build
targets.  Except for several of the MS-DOS packages and GCC for Sun's Solaris
2, there are no precompiled programs on this CD.  You will need a C compiler
(programs which need some other interpreter or compiler normally provide the C
source for a bootstrapping program).


Deluxe Distribution

The Deluxe Distribution Package includes executables and source for all GNU
software in a choice of formats, as well as a printed copy of each of GNU
manuals and an ISO 9660 CD-ROM that contains sources of GNU software.

You may choose one of the following machines and operating systems: HP 9000
series 200, 300, 700, or 800 (4.3 BSD or HPUX); RS/6000 (AIX); Sony NEWS 68k
(4.3 BSD or NewsOS 4); Sun 3, 4, or SPARC (SunOS 4 or Solaris).	 If your
machine or system is not listed, or if a specific program has not been ported
to that machine, please call the FSF office.

We will supply the software on one of the following media in Unix tar format:
1600 or 6250 bpi, 1/2 inch, reel to reel tape; Sun DC300XLP 1/4 inch
cartridge, QIC-24; HP 16 track DC600HC 1/4 inch cartridge; IBM RS/6000 1/4
inch cartridge, QIC-150; and Exabyte 8mm tape.	If your computer cannot read
any of these, please call us.

The manuals included are one each of the Bison, Calc, Gawk, GNU C Compiler,
GNU C Library Reference, GNU Debugger, Flex, GNU Emacs Lisp Reference, Make,
Texinfo, and Termcap manuals; six copies of the GNU Emacs manual; and a packet
