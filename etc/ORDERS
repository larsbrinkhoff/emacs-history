Support will continue to contribute corporate funds to the FSF to
accompany gifts by its employees, and by its customers and their
employees.

   Donations payable to the Free Software Foundation should be sent by
eligible persons to Cygnus Support, which will add its gifts and
forward the total to the FSF each quarter.  The FSF will provide the
contributor with a receipt to recognize the contribution (which is
tax-deductible on U.S.  tax returns).  To see if your employer is a
Cygnus customer, or for more information, please contact Cygnus:

Free Software Redistributors Donate
***********************************

   The SNOW 2.1 CD producers added the words "Includes $5 donation to
the FSF" to the front of their CD.  Potential buyers will know just how
much of the price is for the FSF & how much is for the redistributor.

   The Sun Users Group Deutschland has made it even clearer: their CD
says, "Price 90 DM, + 12 DM donation to the FSF."

   ASCII Corporation (Japan) has also donated to the FSF and plans to
add a donation to the price of their next GNU software CD-ROM.

   Austin Code Works, a free software redistributor, supports free
software development by giving the FSF 20% of the selling price for the
GNU software CDs they produce & sell.

   TOHDO-SHA is donating 400 yen to the FSF for each copy of `The GNU
Emacs Lisp Reference Manual, Japanese Edition' sold at bookstores in
Japan.

   CQ Publishing made a large donation from the sales of their GAWK
book in Japanese, and Specialized Systems Consultants, Inc. is donating
3% of the profits from selling "Effective AWK Programming", by Arnold
Robbins.  Walnut Creek CDROM gives us part of their selling price every
month.

   In the long run, the success of free software depends on how much
new free software people develop.  Free software distribution offers an
opportunity to raise funds for such development in an ethical way.
These redistributors have made use of the opportunity.  Many others let
it go to waste.

   You can help promote free software development by convincing
for-a-fee redistributors to contribute--either by doing development
themselves or by donating to development organizations (the FSF and
others).

   The way to convince distributors to contribute is to demand and
expect this of them.  This means choosing among distributors partly by
how much they give to free software development.  Then you can show
distributors they must compete to be the one who gives the most.

   To make this work, you must insist on numbers that you can compare,
such as, "We will give ten dollars to the Foobar project for each disk
sold." A vague commitment, such as "A portion of the profits is
donated," doesn't give you a basis for comparison.  Even a precise
fraction "of the profits from this disk" is not very meaningful, since
creative accounting and unrelated business decisions can greatly alter
what fraction of the sales price counts as profit.

   Also, press developers for firm information about what kind of
development they do or support.  Some kinds make much more long-term
difference than others.  For example, maintaining a separate version of
a GNU program contributes very little; maintaining a program on behalf
of the GNU Project contributes much.  Easy new ports contribute little,
since someone else would surely do them; difficult ports such as adding
a new CPU to the GNU compiler or Mach contribute more; major new
features & programs contribute the most.

   By establishing the idea that supporting further development is "the
proper thing to do" when distributing free software for a fee, we can
assure a steady flow of resources for making more free software.

    

Help from Free Software Companies
*********************************

   When choosing a free software business, ask those you are considering
how much they do to assist free software development, e.g., by
contributing money to free software development or by writing free
software improvements themselves for general use.  By basing your
decision partially on this factor, you can help encourage those who
profit from free software to contribute to its growth.

   Wingnut (SRA's special GNU support group) regularly donates a part
of its income to the FSF to support the development of new GNU
programs.  Listing them here is our way of thanking them.  Wingnut has
made a pledge to donate 10% of their income to the FSF, and has
purchased several Deluxe Distribution packages in Japan.  Also see

Major Changes in GNU Software and Documentation
***********************************************

   * Hurd Test Release!   (Also *note What Is the Hurd::.)

     We are pleased to announce the first public test release of the
     Hurd, version 0.0; it is very preliminary, and we don't recommend
     you try it unless you are in the mood to experiment.  We are
     distributing it only by FTP until it becomes more stable.

     Much work remains to be done on reliability, efficiency, and on
     user-level features to take advantage of the underlying
     capabilities.  We're making rapid progress on these tasks, and we
     plan to make further releases fairly often.

   * Preliminary GNU System Released!

     The first test release of the Hurd has enabled us to release a
     complete GNU system in binary form, for 32-bit PC clones.  Like
     the Hurd itself, this system release is preliminary, recommended
     for experimentation only, and available only by FTP.  We have thus
     come in sight of the goal which the GNU project was founded to
     achieve.  We will actually reach that goal when the system becomes
     reliable enough that we can recommend it for real use.

   * www.gnu.ai.mit.edu

     The GNU Project now has a site on the World Wide Web at URL:
     `http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu'.  We would like to thank Networks
     On-Line (URL: `http://www.nol.net') for donating use of the
     hardware & Internet connection, and their staff for setting up the
     machine.  We would also like to thank Phil Nelson and Len Tower
     for being the site's webmasters.  They are reachable at
     `webmaster@www.gnu.ai.mit.edu'.

   * New Source Code CD!   (See *Note July 1996 Source Code CD-ROMs::)

     We have released the July 1996 (Edition 8) Source Code CD-ROM.
     Once again, it is a two disk set.  It includes several new
     programs: Automake, `enscript', Exim, `gcal', Generic NQS,
     `geomview', GNAT, GNUMATH, ID Utils, Inetutils, Karma, Lynx,
     Maxima, Miscfiles, Smail, TIFF, and WN.  *Note GNU Software::, for
     more information about these packages.  Also on the CD-ROMs are
     full distributions of X11R6.1, MIT Scheme, Emacs, GCC, and current
     versions of all other GNU Software.

   * GNU Miscellaneous Files Distribution

     We have just released the GNU Miscellaneous Files Distribution,
     which is a collection of non-crucial but useful files.  All the
     files in version 1.0 have come from BSD, but files from other
     sources are eagerly solicited.  Please send bug reports, as well as
     suggestions about new files to include to
     `bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu'.  See the entry in *Note GNU
     Software Now Available::, for more information.

   * Give to GNU the United Way!

     As a 501(c)3 tax-exempt organization, the FSF is eligible to
     receive United Way funds.  When donating to United Way, one can
     specify that all or part of the donation be directed to the FSF.
     On the donor form, check the "Specific Requests" box and include
     the sentence, "Send my gift to the Free Software Foundation, 59
     Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111."

   * Tapes and MS-DOS Diskettes No Longer Available from the FSF

     We no longer offer tapes or MS-DOS diskettes due to very low
     demand.

   * GNU Software Works on MS-DOS   (Also *note GNU Software::.)

     GNU Emacs 19 and many other GNU programs have been ported to
     MS-DOS for i386/i486/Pentium machines.  We ship binaries & sources
     on the *Note Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM::.  We will ship
     binaries & sources on the *Note MS-DOS/Windows Book with CD-ROM::,
     when it is available.

   * GNU Emacs 19.32   (Also *note GNU Software::.)

     We have just released Emacs 19.32.  It mostly fixes bugs, but it
     has a few new features.  The most noticeable one is that marking a
     region with the mouse now leaves the region highlighted at least
     until the next input event.  Also, a new timer system lets you
     efficiently arrange to call a Lisp function at a particular time,
     and mouse tracking is much faster and more reliable.

     Support for MS-DOS and Windows 95 is greatly improved.  You can now
     compile Emacs with DJGPP version 2; asynchronous subprocesses now
     work on Windows 95; and many additional Lisp packages now work on
     MS-DOS.

   * New Release of GNU Make

     GNU `make' 3.75 runs native on three new ports since version 3.74:
     AmigaDOS, VMS, and Windows NT/Windows95.

   * Lynx now GPLed

     Lynx, the popular text-only Web browser is now distributed under
     the terms of the GNU GPL.  For more information, see the Web site
     at `http://www.ukans.edu/'.

   * New/Updated Manuals since Last Bulletin   (See *Note
     Documentation::)

     We recently published the `GNU Awk Users' Guide' by Arnold Robbins,
     which is a greatly expanded and rewritten version of our old `GAWK
     Manual'.  We have a new edition of the Emacs Manual, for version
     19.32, which describes changes since Emacs 19.29.  Our `GNU Make
     Manual' is also a new edition with bug-fixes and additional
     information.  Our `Using and Porting GCC' manual will soon be
     available in a lay-flat, bound edition.

    

The Deluxe Distribution
***********************

   The Free Software Foundation has been asked repeatedly to create a
package that provides executables for all of our software.  Normally we
offer only sources.  The Deluxe Distribution provides binaries with the
source code and includes six T-shirts, all our CD-ROMs, printed
manuals, & reference cards.

   The FSF Deluxe Distribution contains the binaries and sources to
hundreds of different programs including Emacs, the GNU C/C++ Compiler,
the GNU Debugger, the complete X Window System, and all the GNU
utilities.

   We will make a Deluxe Distribution for most machines/operating
systems.  We may be able to send someone to your office to do the
compilation, if we can't find a suitable machine close to us.  However,
we can only compile the programs that already support your chosen
machine/system - porting is a separate matter (to commission a port,
consult the GNU Service Directory; details in *Note Free Software
Support::).  Compiling all these programs takes time; a Deluxe
Distribution for an unusual machine will take longer to produce than
one for a common machine.  Please contact the FSF Office with any
questions.

   We supply the software on a write-once CD-ROM (in ISO 9660 format
with "Rock Ridge" extensions), or on one of these tapes in Unix `tar'
format: 1600 or 6250bpi 1/2in reel, Sun DC300XLP 1/4in cartridge -
QIC24, IBM RS/6000 1/4in c.t. - QIC 150, Exabyte 8mm c.t., or DAT 4mm
c.t.  If your computer cannot read any of these, please contact us to
see if we can handle your format.

   The manuals included are one each of the `Bison', `Calc', `GAWK',
`GNU C Compiler', `GNU C Library', `GDB', `Flex', `GNU Emacs Lisp
Reference', `Programming in Emacs Lisp: An Introduction', `Make',
`Texinfo', & `Termcap' manuals; six copies of the `GNU Emacs' manual;
and ten reference cards each for Emacs, Bison, Calc, Flex, & GDB.

   Every Deluxe Distribution also has a copy of the latest editions of
our CD-ROMs that have sources of our software & compiler tool binaries
for some systems.  The CDs are in ISO 9660 format with Rock Ridge
extensions.

   The price of the Deluxe Distribution is $5000 (shipping included).
These sales provide enormous financial assistance to help the FSF
develop more free software.  To order, please fill out the "Deluxe
Distribution" section on the *note Free Software Foundation Order
Form::.  and send it to:

GNU Documentation
*****************

   GNU is dedicated to having quality, easy-to-use online & printed
documentation.  GNU manuals are intended to explain underlying
concepts, describe how to use all the features of each program, & give
examples of command use.  GNU manuals are distributed as Texinfo source
files, which yield both typeset hardcopy via the TeX document
formatting system and online hypertext display via the menu-driven Info
system.  Source for these manuals comes with our software; here are the
manuals that we publish as printed books.  See the *note Free Software
Foundation Order Form::., to order them.

   Most GNU manuals are bound as soft cover books with "lay-flat"
bindings.  This allows you to open them so they lie flat on a table
without creasing the binding.  They have an inner cloth spine and an
outer cardboard cover that will not break or crease as an ordinary
paperback will.  Currently, the `GDB', `Emacs', `Emacs Lisp Reference',
`Programming in Emacs Lisp: An Introduction', `GNU Awk User's Guide',
`Make', `Bison', & `Texinfo' manuals have this binding.  The other GNU
manuals also lie flat when opened, using a GBC binding.  All our
manuals are 7in by 9.25in except the 8.5in by 11in `Calc' manual.

   The edition number of the manual and version number of the program
listed after each manual's name were current at the time this Bulletin
was published.

   `Debugging with GDB' (Edition 4.12 for Version 4.14) tells how to run
your program under GNU Debugger control, examine and alter data, modify
a program's flow of control, and use GDB through GNU Emacs.

   The `GNU Emacs Manual' (11th Edition for Version 19.32) describes
editing with GNU Emacs.  It explains advanced features, including
outline mode and regular expression search; how to use special
programming modes to write languages like C++ and TeX; how to use the
`tags' utility; how to compile and correct code; how to make your own
keybindings; and other elementary customizations.

   `Programming in Emacs Lisp: An Introduction' (Edition 1.04) is for
people who are not necessarily interested in programming, but who do
want to customize or extend their computing environment.  If you read
it in Emacs under Info mode, you can run the sample programs directly.

   `The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual' (Edition 2.4 for Version 19.32)
and `The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference, Japanese Edition' (Japanese DRAFT
Revision 1.0, from English Edition 2.4 for Version 19.29) cover this
programming language in depth, including data types, control
structures, functions, macros, syntax tables, searching/matching, modes,
windows, keymaps, byte compilation, and the operating system interface.

   `The GNU Awk User's Guide' (Edition 1.0 for Version 3.0.0) tells how
to use GAWK.  It is written for those who have never used `awk' and
describes features of this powerful string and record manipulation
language.

   `GNU Make' (Edition 0.50 for Version 3.75 Beta) describes GNU
`make', a program used to rebuild parts of other programs.  The manual
tells how to write "makefiles", which specify how a program is to be
compiled and how its files depend on each other.  Included are an
introductory chapter for novice users and a section about automatically
generated dependencies.

   The `Flex' manual (Edition 1.03 for Version 2.3.7) teaches you to
write a lexical scanner definition for the `flex' program to create a
C++ or C-coded scanner that recognizes the patterns defined.  You need
no prior knowledge of scanners.

   `The Bison Manual' (November 1995 Edition for Version 1.25) teaches
you how to write context-free grammars for the Bison program that
convert into C-coded parsers.  You need no prior knowledge of parser
generators.

   `Using and Porting GNU CC' (November 1995 Edition for Version 2.7.2)
tells how to run, install, and port the GNU C Compiler to new systems.
It lists new features and incompatibilities of GCC, but people not
familiar with C will still need a good reference on the C programming
language.  It also covers G++.

   The `Texinfo' manual (Edition 2.20 for Version 3) explains the markup
language that produces our online Info documentation & typeset
hardcopies.  It tells you how to make tables, lists, chapters, nodes,
indexes, cross references, & how to catch mistakes.  This second edition
describes over 50 new commands.

   `The Termcap Manual' (3nd Edition for Version 1.3), often described
as "twice as much as you ever wanted to know about termcap," details
the format of the termcap database, the definitions of terminal
capabilities, and the process of interrogating a terminal description.
This manual is primarily for programmers.

   The `C Library Reference Manual' (Edition 0.07 for Version 1.09)
describes the library's facilities, including both what Unix calls
"library functions" & "system calls."  We are doing small copier runs
of this manual until it becomes more stable.  Please send fixes to
`bug-glibc-manual@prep.ai.mit.edu'.

   The `Emacs Calc Manual' (Edition 2.02 for Version 2.02) is both a
tutorial and a reference manual.  It tells how to do ordinary
arithmetic, how to use Calc for algebra, calculus, and other forms of
mathematics, and how to extend Calc.



GNU Software
************

   All our software is available via FTP; see *Note How to Get GNU
Software::.  We also offer *Note CD-ROMs::, and printed *Note
Documentation::, which includes manuals and reference cards.  In the
articles describing the contents of each medium, the version number
listed after each program name was current when we published this
Bulletin.  When you order a newer CD-ROM, some of the programs may be
newer and therefore the version number higher.  See the *note Free
Software Foundation Order Form::., for ordering information.

   Some of the contents of our FTP distributions are compressed.  We
have software on our FTP sites to uncompress these files.  Due to
patent troubles with `compress', we use another compression program,
`gzip'.  (Such prohibitions on software development are fought by the
League for Programming Freedom; *note What Is the LPF::., for details.)

   You may need to build GNU `make' before you build our other software.
Some vendors supply no `make' utility at all and some native `make'
programs lack the `VPATH' feature essential for using the GNU configure
system to its full extent.  The GNU `make' sources have a shell script
to build `make' itself on such systems.

   We welcome all bug reports and enhancements sent to the appropriate
electronic mailing list (*note Free Software Support::.).

    

Configuring GNU Software
------------------------

We are using Autoconf, a uniform scheme for configuring GNU software
packages in order to compile them (see "Autoconf" and "Automake" below,
in this article).  The goal is to have all GNU software support the same
alternatives for naming machine and system types.

   Ultimately, it will be possible to configure and build the entire
system all at once, eliminating the need to configure each individual
package separately.

   You can also specify both the host and target system to build
cross-compilation tools.  Most GNU programs now use Autoconf-generated
configure scripts.

    

GNU Software Now Available
--------------------------

For future programs and features, see *Note Forthcoming GNUs::.

   Key to cross reference:

        BinCD        December 1995 Binaries CD-ROM
        SrcCD        July 1996 Source CD-ROMs

[FSFman] shows that we sell a manual for that package.  [FSFrc] shows
we sell a reference card for that package.  To order them, see the
*note Free Software Foundation Order Form::..  *Note Documentation::,
for more information on the manuals.  Source code for each manual or
reference card is included with each package.

   * `acm'   (SrcCD)

     `acm' is a LAN-oriented, multiplayer, aerial combat simulation that
     runs under the X Window System.  Players engage in air to air
     combat against one another using heat seeking missiles and cannons.
     We are working on a more accurate simulation of real airplane
     flight characteristics.

   * Apache   (SrcCD)

     Apache is an HTTP server designed as a plug-in replacement for
     version 1.3 or 1.4 of the NCSA server.  It fixes many bugs in the
     NCSA server, includes many frequently requested new features, and
     has an API which allows it to be extended to meet users' needs
     more easily.

   * Autoconf   (SrcCD)

     Autoconf produces shell scripts which automatically configure
     source code packages.  These scripts adapt the packages to many
     kinds of Unix-like systems without manual user intervention.
     Autoconf creates a script for a package from a template file which
     lists the operating system features which the package can use, in
     the form of `m4' macro calls.  Autoconf requires GNU `m4' to
     operate, but the resulting configure scripts it generates do not.

   * Automake   (SrcCD)

     Automake is a tool for generating `Makefile.in's for use with
     Autoconf.  The generated makefiles are compliant with GNU Makefile
     standards.

   * BASH   (SrcCD)

     GNU's shell, BASH (Bourne Again SHell), is compatible with the
     Unix `sh' and offers many extensions found in `csh' and `ksh'.
     BASH has job control, `csh'-style command history, command-line
     editing (with Emacs and `vi' modes built-in), and the ability to
     rebind keys via the `readline' library.  BASH conforms to the
     POSIX 1003.2-1992 standard.

   * `bc'   (SrcCD)

     `bc' is an interactive algebraic language with arbitrary precision
     numbers.  GNU `bc' follows the POSIX 1003.2-1992 standard with
     several extensions, including multi-character variable names, an
     `else' statement, and full Boolean expressions.  The RPN
     calculator `dc' is now distributed as part of the same package,
     but GNU `bc' is not implemented as a `dc' preprocessor.

   * BFD   (BinCD, SrcCD)

     The Binary File Descriptor library allows a program which operates
     on object files (e.g., `ld' or GDB) to support many different
     formats in a clean way.  BFD provides a portable interface, so
     that only BFD needs to know the details of a particular format.
     One result is that all programs using BFD will support formats
     such as a.out, COFF, and ELF.  BFD comes with Texinfo source for a
     manual (not yet published on paper).

     At present, BFD is not distributed separately; it is included with
     packages that use it.

   * Binutils   (BinCD, SrcCD)

     Binutils includes these programs: `ar', `c++filt', `demangle',
     `gas', `gprof', `ld', `nlmconv', `nm', `objcopy', `objdump',
     `ranlib', `size', `strings', & `strip'.

     Binutils version 2 uses the BFD library.  The GNU assembler, `gas',
     supports the a29k, Alpha, H8/300, H8/500, HP-PA, i386, i960, m68k,
     m88k, MIPS, NS32K, SH, SPARC, Tahoe, Vax, and Z8000 CPUs, and
     attempts to be compatible with many other assemblers for Unix and
     embedded systems.  It can produce mixed C and assembly listings,
     and includes a macro facility similar to that in some other
     assemblers.  GNU's linker, `ld', emits source-line numbered error
     messages for multiply-defined symbols and undefined references,
     and interprets a superset of AT&T's Linker Command Language, which
     gives control over where segments are placed in memory.  `nlmconv'
     converts object files into Novell NetWare Loadable Modules.
     `objdump' can disassemble code for most of the CPUs listed above,
     and can display other data (e.g., symbols and relocations) from
     any file format read by BFD.

   * Bison   (BinCD, SrcCD)   [FSFman, FSFrc]

     Bison is an upwardly compatible replacement for the parser
     generator `yacc'.  Texinfo source for the `Bison Manual' and
     reference card are included; see *Note Documentation::.

     A recent policy change allows non-free programs to use
     Bison-generated parsers.

   * C Library   *See *Note Forthcoming GNUs::*   (BinCD, SrcCD)  
     [FSFman]

     The GNU C library supports ANSI C-1989, POSIX 1003.1-1990 and most
     of the functions in POSIX 1003.2-1992.  It is upwardly compatible
     with 4.4BSD and includes many System V functions, plus GNU
     extensions.

     When used with the GNU Hurd, the C Library performs many functions
     of the Unix system calls directly.  Mike Haertel has written a
     fast `malloc' which wastes less memory than the old GNU version.
     The GNU regular-expression functions (`regex' and `rx') now nearly
     conform to the POSIX 1003.2 standard.

     GNU `stdio' lets you define new kinds of streams, just by writing a
     few C functions.  The `fmemopen' function uses this to open a
     stream on a string, which can grow as necessary.  You can define
     your own `printf' formats to use a C function you have written.
     For example, you can safely use format strings from user input to
     implement a `printf'-like function for another programming
     language.  Extended `getopt' functions are already used to parse
     options, including long options, in many GNU utilities.  Texinfo
     source for the `GNU C Library Reference Manual' is included (*note
     Documentation::.).

     It runs on Sun-3 (SunOS 4.1), Sun-4 (SunOS 4.1 or Solaris 2), HP
     9000/300 (4.3BSD), SONY News 800 (NewsOS 3 or 4), MIPS DECstation
     (Ultrix 4), DEC Alpha (OSF/1), i386/i486/Pentium (GNU/Hurd,
     GNU/Linux, System V, SVR4, BSD, SCO 3.2, & SCO ODT 2.0), Sequent
     Symmetry i386 (Dynix 3), & SGI (Irix 4).

   * C++ Library   (BinCD, SrcCD)

     The GNU C++ library (libg++) contains an extensive collection of
     container and utility classes, including Obstacks,
     multiple-precision Integers and Rationals, Complex numbers,
     BitSets, and BitStrings.

     The distribution also includes the libstdc++ library.  This
     implements library facilities defined by the forthcoming ANSI/ISO
     C++ standard, including strings, the iostream library, and a port
     of the Standard Template Library.

   * Calc   (SrcCD)   [FSFman, FSFrc]

     Calc (written by Dave Gillespie in Emacs Lisp) is an extensible,
     advanced desk calculator & mathematical tool that runs as part of
     GNU Emacs.  You can use Calc as a simple four-function calculator,
     but it has many more features including: choice of algebraic or
     RPN (stack-based) entry; logarithmic, trigonometric, & financial
     functions; arbitrary precision; complex numbers; vectors;
     matrices; dates; times; infinities; sets; algebraic
     simplification; & differentiation & integration.  It outputs to
     `gnuplot', & comes with source for a manual & reference card
     (*note Documentation::.).

   * `cfengine'   (SrcCD)

     `cfengine' is used to maintain site-wide configuration of a
     heterogeneous Unix network using a simple high level language.  Its
     appearance is similar to `rdist', but allows many more operations
     to be performed automatically.  See Mark Burgess, "A Site
     Configuration Engine", `Computing Systems', Vol. 8, No. 3 (ask
     `office@usenix.org' how to get a copy).

   * Chess   (SrcCD)

     GNU Chess lets most modern computers play a full game of chess.  It
     has a plain terminal interface, a curses interface, & `xboard''s
     spiffy X Window interface.

     Recent improvements include fixes to the game analyzer, book, &
     hash table; smartening up draw & mate; improved thinking on
     opponent's time; Autoconf installation; a makefile for Windows NT
     compilation; forward pruning; unlimited quiescence captures;
     improved evaluation; improved null & time control logic; &
     repetition-detection.

     Stuart Cracraft started GNU Chess.  Improvements & rewrites are
     from John Stanback, Cha Kong Sian, Mike McGann, et al.

     Send bugs to `bug-gnu-chess@prep.ai.mit.edu' & general comments to
     `info-gnu-chess@prep.ai.mit.edu'.

   * CLISP   (SrcCD)

     CLISP is a Common Lisp implementation by Bruno Haible and Michael
     Stoll.  It mostly supports the Lisp described by `Common LISP: The
     Language (2nd edition)' and the ANSI Common Lisp standard.  CLISP
     includes an interpreter, a byte-compiler, a large subset of CLOS,
     a foreign language interface, and, for some machines, a screen
     editor.  The user interface language (English, German, French) can
     be chosen at run time.  Major packages that run in CLISP include
     CLX & Garnet.  CLISP needs only 2 MB of memory & runs on many
     microcomputers (including MS-DOS systems, OS/2, Windows NT, Amiga
     500-4000, and Acorn RISC PC) & Unix-like systems (GNU/Linux, Sun4,
     SVR4, SGI, HP-UX, DEC Alpha, NeXTStep, & others).

   * Common Lisp   *Also *note Forthcoming GNUs::.*   (SrcCD)

     GNU Common Lisp (GCL, formerly known as Kyoto Common Lisp) is a
     compiler & interpreter for Common Lisp.  GCL is very portable &
     extremely efficient on a wide class of applications, & compares
     favorably in performance with commercial Lisps on several large
     theorem-prover & symbolic algebra systems.  GCL supports the CLtL1
     specification but is moving towards the proposed ANSI standard.

     GCL compiles to C & then uses the native optimizing C compiler
     (e.g., GCC).  A function with a fixed number of args & one value
     turns into a C function of the same number of args, returning one
     value--so GCL is maximally efficient on such calls.  Its
     conservative garbage collector gives great freedom to the C
     compiler to put Lisp values in registers.  It has a source level
     Lisp debugger for interpreted code & displays source code in an
     Emacs window.  Its profiler (based on the C profiling tools)
     counts function calls & the time spent in each function.

     There is now a built-in interface to the Tk widget system.  It runs
     in a separate process, so users may monitor progress on Lisp
     computations or interact with running computations via a windowing
     interface.

     There is also an Xlib interface via C (xgcl-2)®  CLX runs with
     GCL, as does PCL (see "PCL" later in this article).

     GCL version 2.2 is released under the GNU Library General Public
     License.

   * CLX   (SrcCD)

     CLX is an X Window interface library for GCL.  This is separate
     from the built-in TK interface.

   * `cpio'   (SrcCD)

     `cpio' is an archive program with all the features of SVR4 `cpio',
     including support for the final POSIX 1003.1 `ustar' standard.
     `mt', a program to position magnetic tapes, is included with
     `cpio'.

   * CVS   (SrcCD)

     CVS is a version control system (like RCS or SCCS) which allows
     you to keep old versions of files (usually source code), keep a
     log of who, when, and why changes occurred, etc.  It handles
     multiple developers, multiple directories, triggers to
     enable/log/control various operations, and can work over a wide
     area network.  It does not handle build management or
     bug-tracking; these are handled by `make' and GNATS, respectively.

   * DejaGnu   (SrcCD)

     DejaGnu is a framework to test programs with a single front end
     for all tests.  DejaGnu's flexibility & consistency makes it easy
     to write tests.

     DejaGnu comes with `expect', which runs scripts to conduct dialogs
     with programs.

   * Diffutils   (SrcCD)

     GNU `diff' compares files showing line-by-line changes in several
     flexible formats.  It is much faster than traditional Unix
     versions.  The Diffutils package contains `diff', `diff3',
     `sdiff', & `cmp'.  Recent improvements include more consistent
     handling of character sets and a new `diff' option to do all
     input/output in binary; this is useful on some non-POSIX hosts.
     Plans for the Diffutils package include support for
     internationalization (e.g., error messages in Chinese) and for some
     non-Unix PC environments.

   * DJGPP   (BinCD)

     DJ Delorie has ported GCC/G++ (see "GCC" in this article) to i386s
     running MS-DOS.  DJGPP has a 32-bit i386 DOS extender with a
     symbolic debugger, development libraries, & ports of Bison,
     `flex', & Binutils.  Full source code is provided.  It needs at
     least 5MB of hard disk space to install & 512K of RAM to use.  It
     supports SVGA (up to 1024x768), XMS & VDISK memory allocation,
     `himem.sys', VCPI (e.g., QEMM, DESQview, & 386MAX), & DPMI (e.g.,
     Windows 3.x, OS/2, QEMM, & QDPMI).  DJGPP Version 2 was released
     in Feb 1996, & needs a DPMI environment; a free DPMI server is
     included.

     FTP from `ftp.simtel.net' in `/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/' (or
     another SimTel mirror site).

     Ask `listserv@delorie.com', to join a DJGPP users mailing list.

   * `dld'   (SrcCD)

     `dld' is a dynamic linker written by W. Wilson Ho.  Linking your
     program with the `dld' library allows you to dynamically load
     object files into the running binary.  `dld' supports a.out object
     types on the following platforms: Convex C-Series (BSD),
     i386/i486/Pentium (Linux), Sequent Symmetry i386 (Dynix 3), Sun-3
     (SunOS 3 & 4), Sun-4 (SunOS 4), & VAX (Ultrix).

   * `doschk'   (SrcCD)

     This program is a utility to help software developers ensure that
     their source file names are distinguishable on System V platforms
     with 14-character filenames and on MS-DOS systems with 8+3
     character filenames.

   * `ecc'   (SrcCD)

     `ecc' is a Reed-Solomon error correction checking library and
     sample program, which can correct three byte errors in a block of
     255 bytes and detect more severe errors.  Contact `fclim@acm.org'
     for more information.

   * `ed'   (SrcCD)

     `ed' is the standard text editor.  It is line-oriented and can be
     used interactively or in scripts.

   * Elib   (SrcCD)

     Elib is a small library of Emacs Lisp functions, including
     routines for using AVL trees and doubly-linked lists.

   * Elisp archive   (SrcCD)

     This is a snapshot of Ohio State's GNU Emacs Lisp FTP Archive.
     FTP it from `archive.cis.ohio-state.edu' in
     `/pub/gnu/emacs/elisp-archive'.

   * Emacs   *Also *note Forthcoming GNUs::.*   [FSFman(s), FSFrc]

     In 1975, Richard Stallman developed the first Emacs, an extensible,
     customizable real-time display editor & computing environment.
     GNU Emacs is his second implementation.  It offers true
     Lisp--smoothly integrated into the editor--for writing extensions
     & provides an interface to the X Window System.  It runs on Unix,
     MS-DOS, & Windows NT or 95.  In addition to its powerful native
     command set, Emacs can emulate the editors vi & EDT (Digital's VMS
     editor).  Emacs has many other features which make it a full
     computing support environment.  Source for the `GNU Emacs Manual' &
     a reference card comes with the software.  Sources for the `GNU
     Emacs Lisp Reference Manual', & `Programming in Emacs Lisp: An
     Introduction' are distributed in separate packages.  *Note
     Documentation::.

   * Emacs 19   (SrcCD)   [FSFman(s), FSFrc]

     Emacs 19 works with character-only terminals & with the X Window
     System (with or without an X toolkit).  New Emacs 19 features
     include: multiple X windows ("frames" to Emacs), with a separate X
     window for the minibuffer or a minibuffer attached to each X
     window; use of the X toolkit; interfacing with the X resource
     manager; property lists associated with regions of text in a
     buffer; multiple fonts & colors defined by those properties;
     simplified/improved processing of function keys, mouse movement &
     clicks; X selection processing, including clipboard selections;
     hooks to be run if the point or mouse moves outside a certain
     range; menu bars & popup menus defined by keymaps; scrollbars;
     before- & after-change hooks; a source-level debugger for Emacs
     Lisp programs; floating point numbers; improved buffer allocation,
     including returning storage to the system when a buffer is killed;
     many updated libraries; Autoconf-based configuration; support for
     version control systems (CVS, RCS, & SCCS); & European character
     sets.

     Recent features include the ability to open frames on more than
     one X display from a single Emacs job, operation under MS-DOS, MS
     Windows, and Windows NT, displaying multiple views of an outline
     at the same time, Lisp-level timers for real time and idle time,
     version control support for CVS and for multiple branches, text
     properties for formatting text, commands to edit text properties
     and save them in files, and GNU-standard long-named command line
     options.  Also see *Note Forthcoming GNUs::.

   * Emacs 18   (SrcCD)   [FSFrc]

     Emacs 18 is several years old.  We no longer maintain it, but still
     distribute it for those using platforms which Emacs 19 does not
     support: Alliant FX/80, Altos 3068, Amdahl (UTS), AT&T (3Bs & 7300
     PC), CCI 5/32 & 6/32, Celerity, Digital (VAX VMS), Dual, Encore

     E30 (SS5E), Whitechapel (MG1), & Wicat.

   * `es'   (SrcCD)

     `es' is an extensible shell (based on `rc') with first-class
     functions, lexical scope, exceptions, and rich return values (i.e.,
     functions can return values other than just numbers).  `es''s
     extensibility comes from the ability to modify and extend the
     shell's built-in services, such as path searching and redirection.
     Like `rc', it is great for both interactive use and scripting,
     particularly since its quoting rules are much less baroque than
     the C and Bourne shells.

   * `enscript'   (SrcCD)

     `enscript' is an upwardly-compatible replacement for the Adobe
     `enscript' program.  It formats ASCII files (outputting in
     Postscript) and stores generated output to a file or sends it
     directly to the printer.

   * Exim   (SrcCD)

     Exim is a new, somewhat experimental mail transfer agent, patterned
     after some of the lessons learned during the development of Smail.
     Exim can handle relatively high volume mail systems, caching of
     mail delivery, header rewriting, multiple local domains from one
     mail system, and control over which hosts/nets may use it as a
     relay.

   * `f2c'   (SrcCD)

     `f2c' converts Fortran-77 source into C or C++, which can be
     compiled with GCC or G++.  Get bug fixes by FTP from site
     `netlib.bell-labs.com' or by email from
     `netlib@netlib.bell-labs.com'.  For a summary, see the file
     `/netlib/f2c/readme.Z'.  Also see the Fortran items later in this
     article, and in *Note Forthcoming GNUs::.

   * `ffcall'   (SrcCD)

     `ffcall' is a C library for implementing foreign function calls in
     embedded interpreters by Bill Triggs and Bruno Haible.  It allows C
     functions with arbitrary argument lists and return types to be
     called or emulated (callbacks).

   * Fileutils   (SrcCD)

     The Fileutils are: `chgrp', `chmod', `chown', `cp', `dd', `df',
     `dir', `dircolors', `du', `install', `ln', `ls', `mkdir', `mkfifo',
     `mknod', `mv', `rm', `rmdir', `sync', `touch', & `vdir'.

   * Findutils   (SrcCD)

     `find' is frequently used both interactively and in shell scripts
     to find files which match certain criteria and perform arbitrary
     operations on them.  Also included are `locate', which scans a
     database for file names that match a pattern, and `xargs', which
     applies a command to a list of files.

   * Finger   (SrcCD)

     GNU Finger has more features than other finger programs.  For
     sites with many hosts, a single host may be designated as the
     finger "server" host and other hosts at that site configured as
     finger "clients".  The server host collects information about who
     is logged in on the clients.  To finger a user at a GNU Finger
     site, a query to any of its client hosts gets useful information.
     GNU Finger supports many customization features, including user
     output filters and site-programmable output for special target
     names.

   * `flex'   (BinCD, SrcCD)   [FSFman, FSFrc]

     `flex' is a replacement for the `lex' scanner generator.  `flex'
     was written by Vern Paxson of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and
     generates far more efficient scanners than `lex' does.  Sources
     for the `Flex Manual' and reference card are included (*note
     Documentation::.).

   * Fortran (`g77')   *Also *note Forthcoming GNUs::.*   (SrcCD)

     GNU Fortran (`g77'), developed by Craig Burley, is available for
     public beta testing on the Internet.  For now, `g77' produces code
     that is mostly object-compatible with `f2c' & uses the same
     run-time library (`libf2c').

   * Fontutils   (SrcCD)

     The Fontutils convert between font formats, create fonts for use
     with Ghostscript or TeX (starting with a scanned type image &
     converting the bitmaps to outlines), etc.  It includes: `bpltobzr',
     `bzrto', `charspace', `fontconvert', `gsrenderfont', `imageto',
     `imgrotate', `limn', & `xbfe'.

   * GAWK   (SrcCD)   [FSFman]

     GAWK is upwardly compatible with the latest POSIX specification of
     `awk'.  It also provides several useful extensions not found in
     other `awk' implementations.  Texinfo source for the `The GNU Awk
     User's Guide' comes with the software (*note Documentation::.).

   * `gcal'   (SrcCD)

     `gcal' is a program for printing calendars.  It displays different
     styled calendar sheets, eternal holiday lists, and fixed date
     warning lists.

   * GCC   *Also *note Forthcoming GNUs::.*   (BinCD, SrcCD)   [FSFman]

     Version 2 of the GNU C Compiler supports the languages C, C++, and
     Objective-C; the source file name suffix or a compiler option
     selects the language.  Objective-C support was donated by NeXT.
     The runtime support needed to run Objective-C programs is now
     distributed with GCC (this does not include any Objective-C
     classes aside from `object', but see "GNUstep" in *Note
     Forthcoming GNUs::).  As much as possible, G++ is kept compatible
     with the evolving draft ANSI standard, but not with `cfront'
     (AT&T's compiler), which has been diverging from ANSI.

     GCC is a fairly portable optimizing compiler which performs
     automatic register allocation, common sub-expression elimination
     (CSE) (including a certain amount of CSE between basic blocks -
     though not all the supported machine descriptions provide for
     scheduling or delay slots), invariant code motion from loops,
     induction variable optimizations, constant propagation, copy
     propagation, delayed popping of function call arguments, tail
     recursion elimination, integration of inline functions & frame
     pointer elimination, instruction scheduling, loop unrolling,
     filling of delay slots, leaf function optimization, optimized
     multiplication by constants, the ability to assign attributes to
     instructions, & many local optimizations automatically deduced
     from the machine description.

     GCC can open-code most arithmetic on 64-bit values (type `long long
     int').  It supports extended floating point (type `long double') on
     the 68k; other machines will follow.  GCC supports full ANSI C,
     traditional C, & GNU C extensions (including: nested functions
     support, nonlocal gotos, & taking the address of a label).

     GCC can generate a.out, COFF, ELF, & OSF-Rose files when used with
     a suitable assembler.  It can produce debugging information in
     these formats: BSD stabs, COFF, ECOFF, ECOFF with stabs, & DWARF.

     GCC generates code for many CPUs, including the a29k, Alpha, ARM,
     AT&T, DSP1610, Clipper, Convex cN, Elxsi, Fujitsu Gmicro, i370,

     Using the configuration scheme for GCC, building a cross-compiler
     is as easy as building a native compiler.

     Version 1 of GCC, G++, & libg++ are no longer maintained.

     Texinfo source for the `Using and Porting GNU CC' manual is
     included with GCC (*note Documentation::.).

   * GDB   (BinCD, SrcCD)   [FSFman, FSFrc]

     GDB, the GNU DeBugger, is a source-level debugger for C, C++, and
     Fortran.

     GDB can debug both C and C++ programs, and will work with
     executables produced by many different compilers; however, C++
     debugging will have some limitations if you do not use GCC.

     GDB has a command line user interface, and Emacs has GDB mode as an
     interface.  Two X interfaces (not distributed or maintained by the
     FSF) are: `gdbtk' (FTP it from `ftp.cygnus.com' in directory
     `/pub/gdb'); and `xxgdb' (FTP it from `ftp.x.org' in directory
     `/contrib/utilities').

     Executable files and symbol tables are read via the BFD library,
     which allows a single copy of GDB to debug programs with multiple
     object file formats (e.g., a.out, COFF, ELF).  Other features
     include a rich command language, remote debugging over serial
     lines or TCP/IP, and watchpoints (breakpoints triggered when the
     value of an expression changes).

     GDB uses a standard remote interface to a simulator library which
     (so far) has simulators for the ARM, Hitachi H8/300, Hitachi
     H8/500, Hitachi Super-H, PowerPC, WDC 65816, & Zilog Z8001/2.

     GDB can perform cross-debugging.  To say that GDB "targets" a
     platform means it can perform native or cross-debugging for it.
     To say that GDB can "host" a given platform means that it can be
     built on it, but cannot necessarily debug native programs.

     GDB can:

        * "target" & "host": Amiga 3000 (Amix, NetBSD), DEC Alpha
          (OSF/1), DECstation 3100 & 5000 (Ultrix), HP 9000/300 (BSD,

     Sources for the manual, `Debugging with GDB', and a reference card
     are included (*note Documentation::.).

   * `gdbm'   (SrcCD)

     `gdbm' is the GNU replacement for the traditional `dbm' and `ndbm'
     libraries.  It implements a database using quick lookup by
     hashing.  `gdbm' does not ordinarily make sparse files (unlike its
     Unix and BSD counterparts).

   * `gettext'    *Also *note Help the GNU Translation Project::.*  
     (SrcCD)

     The GNU `gettext' tool set has everything maintainers need to
     internationalize a package's user messages.  Once a package has
     been internationalized, `gettext''s many tools help translators
     localize messages to their native language and automate handling
     the translation files.

   * Generic NQS   (SrcCD)

     Generic NQS is a network queuing system for spreading batch jobs
     across a network of machines.  It is designed to be simple to
     install on a heterogeneous network of machines, and has
     optimizations for running on the high end, symmetric
     multiprocessing servers that are currently on the market.  It
     inter-operates with other NQS systems, including Cray's NQE.

   * `geomview'   (SrcCD)

     `geomview' is an interactive geometry viewing program.  It allows
     multiple independently controllable objects and cameras.
     `geomview' provides interactive control for motion, appearances
     (including lighting, shading, and materials), picking on an
     object, edge or vertex level, and snapshots in SGI image file or
     Renderman RIB format.  Adding or deleting objects is provided
     through direct mouse manipulation, control panels, and keyboard
     shortcuts.  External programs can drive desired aspects of the
     viewer (such as continually loading changing geometry or
     controlling the motion of certain objects) while allowing
     interactive control of everything else.

   * Ghostscript   *Also *note Forthcoming GNUs::.*   (SrcCD)

     Ghostscript is an interpreter for the Postscript and PDF graphics
     languages.

     The current version of GNU Ghostscript is 3.33.  This version
     includes nearly a full Postscript Level 2 interpreter and also a
     PDF 1.0 interpreter.  Significant new features include: support
     for anti-aliased characters; the ability to scan a directory and
     register all the fonts in it; support for Type 0 (Japanese /
     Chinese / Korean) fonts; and the ability to compile all the
     external initialization files into the executable.  This version
     can also run as a 32-bit MS Windows application.

     Thanks to the generosity of URW++ (Hamburg, Germany), the
     low-quality bitmap-derived fonts distributed with older versions
     have been replaced with commercial-quality, hinted outline fonts.
     *Note GNUs Flashes::.

     Ghostscript executes commands in the Postscript language by writing
     directly to a printer, drawing on an X window, or writing to files
     for printing later or manipulating with other graphics programs.

     Ghostscript includes a C-callable graphics library (for client
     programs that do not want to deal with the Postscript language).
     It also supports i386/i486/Pentiums running DOS with EGA, VGA or
     SuperVGA graphics (but please do *not* ask the FSF staff any
     questions about this; we do not use DOS).

   * Ghostview   (SrcCD)

     Tim Theisen, `ghostview@cs.wisc.edu', created Ghostview, a
     previewer for multi-page files with an X Window interface.
     Ghostview & Ghostscript work together; Ghostview creates a viewing
     window & Ghostscript draws in it.

   * GIT   (SrcCD)

     The GNU Interactive Tools package includes: an extensible file
     system browser, an ASCII/hex file viewer, a process viewer/killer,
     & other related utilities & shell scripts.  It can be used to
     increase the speed & efficiency of many daily tasks, such as
     copying & moving files & directories, invoking editors,
     compressing/uncompressing files, creating & expanding archives,
     compiling programs, sending mail, etc.  It looks nice, has colors
     (if the standard ANSI color sequences are supported), & is
     user-friendly.

   * `gmp'   (SrcCD)

     GNU `mp' is a library for arithmetic on arbitrary precision
     integers, rational numbers, and floating-point numbers.  It has a
     rich set of functions with a regular interface.

     A major new release, version 2.0, is now out.  Compared to previous
     versions, it is much faster, & contains lots of new functions.
     The main new feature is support for arbitrary precision
     floating-point numbers.

   * Gnans    (SrcCD)

     Gnans is a program (and language) for the numerical study of
     deterministic and stochastic dynamical systems.  The dynamical

     graphical & command line interfaces.

   * GNAT: The GNU Ada Translator   (SrcCD)

     A front end for much of Ada 95 (GNAT: The GNU Ada Translator) is
     available via anonymous FTP from `cs.nyu.edu' in `/pub/gnat'.  SGI
     and Digital have chosen GNU Ada as the Ada compiler for certain
     systems.  News about GNAT is posted to the USENET newsgroup
     `comp.lang.ada'.

   * GNATS   (SrcCD)

     GNATS (GNats: A Tracking System, not to be confused with GNAT, The
     GNU Ada Translator) is a bug-tracking system.  It is based upon
     the paradigm of a central site or organization which receives
     problem reports and negotiates their resolution by electronic
     mail.  Although it has been used primarily as a software
     bug-tracking system so far, it is sufficiently generalized that it
     could be used for handling system administration issues, project
     management, or any number of other applications.

   * GNUMATH (`gnussl')   (SrcCD)

     GNUMATH is a library (`gnussl') designed to simplify scientific
     programming.  Its focus is on problems that can be solved by a
     straight-forward application of numerical, linear algebra.  It
     also handles plotting.  GNUMATH is in beta release; it is expected
     to grow more versatile and offer a wider scope in time.

   * `gnuplot'   (SrcCD)

     `gnuplot' is an interactive program for plotting mathematical
     expressions and data.  It plots both curves (2 dimensions) &
     surfaces (3 dimensions).  It was neither written nor named for the
     GNU Project; the name is a coincidence.  Various GNU programs use
     `gnuplot'.

   * `gnuserv'   (SrcCD)

     `gnuserv' is an enhanced version of Emacs' `emacsclient' program.
     It lets the user direct a running Emacs to edit files or evaluate
     arbitrary Emacs Lisp constructs from another process.

   * GnuGo   (SrcCD)

     GnuGo plays the game of Go (Wei-Chi); version 1.2 was released
     with minor changes for portability,  but it is not yet very
     sophisticated.

   * `gperf'   (SrcCD)

     `gperf' generates perfect hash tables.  The C version is in
     package cperf.  The C++ version is in libg++.  Both produce hash
     functions in either C or C++.

   * Graphics   (SrcCD)

     GNU Graphics produces x-y plots from ASCII or binary data.  It
     outputs in Postscript, Tektronix 4010 compatible, and Unix
     device-independent "plot" formats.  It has a previewer for the X
     Window System.  Features include a `spline' interpolation program;
     examples of shell scripts using `graph' and `plot'; a statistics
     toolkit; and output in TekniCAD TDA and ln03 file formats.  Email
     bugs or queries to Rich Murphey, `Rich@lamprey.utmb.edu'.

   * grep   (SrcCD)

     lines that match entered patterns.  They are much faster than the
     traditional Unix versions.

   * Groff   (SrcCD)

     Groff is a document formatting system based on a
     device-independent version of `troff', & includes: `eqn', `nroff',
     `pic', `refer', `tbl', `troff'; the `man', `ms', & `mm' macros; &
     drivers for Postscript, TeX `dvi' format, the LaserJet 4 series of
     printers, and typewriter-like devices.  Groff's `mm' macro package
     is almost compatible with the DWB `mm' macros with several
     extensions.  Also included is a modified version of the Berkeley
     `me' macros and an enhanced version of the X11 `xditview'
     previewer.  Written in C++, these programs can be compiled with
     GNU C++ Version 2.7.2 or later.

     Groff users are encouraged to contribute enhancements.  Most needed
     are complete Texinfo documentation, a `grap' emulation (a `pic'
     preprocessor for typesetting graphs), a page-makeup postprocessor
     similar to `pm' (see `Computing Systems', Vol. 2, No. 2; ask
     `office@usenix.org' how to get a copy), and an ASCII output class
     for `pic' to integrate `pic' with Texinfo.  Questions and bug
     reports from users who have read the documentation provided with
     Groff can be sent to `bug-groff@prep.ai.mit.edu'.

   * `gzip'   (SrcCD)

     `gzip' can expand LZW-compressed files but uses another, unpatented
     algorithm for compression which generally produces better results.
     It also expands files compressed with System V's `pack' program.

   * `hello'   (SrcCD)

     The GNU `hello' program produces a familiar, friendly greeting.  It
     allows non-programmers to use a classic computer science tool
     which would otherwise be unavailable to them.  Because it is
     protected by the GNU General Public License, users are free to
     share and change it.  `hello' is also a good example of a program
     that meets the GNU coding standards.  Like any truly useful
     program, `hello' contains a built-in mail reader.

   * `hp2xx'   (SrcCD)

     GNU `hp2xx' reads HP-GL files, decomposes all drawing commands into
     elementary vectors, and converts them into a variety of vector and
     raster output formats.  It is also an HP-GL previewer.  Currently
     supported vector formats include encapsulated Postscript, Uniplex
     RGIP, Metafont, various special TeX-related formats, and
     simplified HP-GL (line drawing only) for imports.  Raster formats
     supported include IMG, PBM, PCX, & HP-PCL (including Deskjet &

   * `mkisofs'   (SrcCD)

     `mkisofs' is a pre-mastering program to generate an ISO 9660 file
     system.  It takes a snapshot of a directory tree, and makes a
     binary image which corresponds to an ISO 9660 file system when
     written to a block device.

     It can also generate the System Use Sharing Protocol records of
     the Rock Ridge Interchange Protocol (used to further describe the
     files in an ISO 9660 file system to a Unix host; it provides
     information such as longer filenames, uid/gid, permissions, and
     device nodes).

     The `mkisofs' program is frequently used with `cdwrite'.
     `cdwrite' works by taking the image that `mkisofs' generates and
     driving a cdwriter to actually burn the disk.  `cdwrite' works
     under Linux, and supports popular cdwriters.  Older versions of
     `cdwrite' were included with older versions of `mkisofs'; check
     `sunsite.unc.edu' & get

     character-based terminals, and can output Embedded Postscript
     renditions of spreadsheets.  Keybindings should be familiar to
     Emacs users and are configurable.  Oleo supports multiple
     variable-width fonts when used under the X Window System or
     outputting to Postscript devices.

   * `p2c'   (SrcCD)

     `p2c' is Dave Gillespie's Pascal-to-C translator.  It inputs many
     dialects (HP, ISO, Turbo, VAX, etc.)  & generates readable,
     maintainable, portable C.

   * `patch'   (SrcCD)

     `patch' is our version of Larry Wall's program to take `diff''s
     output and apply those differences to an original file to generate
     the modified version.

   * PCL   (SrcCD)

     PCL is a free implementation of a large subset of CLOS, the Common
     Lisp Object System.  It runs under both GCL and CLISP, mentioned
     above.

   * `perl'   (SrcCD)

     Larry Wall's `perl' combines the features & capabilities of C,
     `sed', `awk', & `sh', and provides interfaces to the Unix system
     calls & many C library routines.

   * `pine'   *Also *note Some Bad News about Pine::.*   (SrcCD)

     `pine' is a friendly menu-driven electronic mail manager and user
     interface .

   * `ptx'    *Also *note Forthcoming GNUs::.*   (SrcCD)

     GNU `ptx' is our version of the traditional permuted index
     generator.  It handles multiple input files at once, has TeX
     compatible output, & outputs readable "KWIC" (KeyWords In Context)
     indexes without using `nroff'.

     It does not yet handle input files that do not fit in memory all at
     once.

   * `rc'   (SrcCD)

     `rc' is a shell that features a C-like syntax (much more so than
     `csh') and far cleaner quoting rules than the C or Bourne shells.
     It's intended to be used interactively, but is also great for
     writing scripts.  It inspired the shell `es'.

   * RCS   (SrcCD)

     RCS, the Revision Control System, is used for version control &
     management of software projects.  Used with GNU `diff', RCS can
     handle binary files (8-bit data, executables, object files, etc).
     RCS now conforms to GNU configuration standards & to POSIX
     1003.1b-1993.  Also see the CVS item above.

   * `recode'    *Also *note Forthcoming GNUs::.*   (SrcCD)

     GNU `recode' converts files between character sets and usages.
     When exact transliterations are not possible, it may delete the
     offending characters or fall back on approximations.  This program
     recognizes or outputs nearly 150 different character sets and is
     able to transliterate files between almost any pair.  Most RFC
     1345 character sets are supported.

   * `regex'   (SrcCD)

     The GNU regular expression library supports POSIX.2, except for
     internationalization features.  It is included in many GNU
     programs which do regular expression matching & is available
     separately.  An alternate regular expression package, `rx', is
     faster than `regex' in most cases & will replace `regex' over time.

   * `rx'   (SrcCD)

     Tom Lord has written `rx', a new regular expression library which
     is faster than the older GNU `regex' library.  It is now being
     distributed with `sed' and `tar'.  `rx' will be used in the next
     releases of `m4' and `ptx'.

   * SAOimage   (SrcCD)

     SAOimage is an X-based astronomical image viewer.  It reads data
     images and displays them with a pseudocolor colormap.  There is
     full interactive control of the colormap, reading, and writing of
     colormaps, etc.

   * Scheme   (SrcCD)

     Scheme is a simplified, lexically-scoped dialect of Lisp.  It was
     designed at MIT and other universities to teach students the art
     of programming and to research new parallel programming constructs
     and compilation techniques.

     We now distribute MIT Scheme 7.3, which conforms to the "Revised^4
     Report On the Algorithmic Language Scheme" (MIT AI Lab Memo 848b),
     for which TeX source is included.  It is written partly in C, but
     is presently hard to bootstrap.  Binaries to bootstrap it exist
     for: HP9000 series 300, 400, 700, & 800 (running HP-UX 9.0), NeXT
     (NeXT OS 2 or 3.2), DEC Alpha (OSF/1), IBM RS/6000 (AIX), Sun-3 or
     Sun-4 (SunOS 4.1), DECstation 3100/5100 (Ultrix 4.0), Sony
     NeWS-3250 (NEWS OS 5.01), & Intel i386 (MS-DOS, Windows 3.1 or NT).
     If your system isn't on this list & you don't enjoy the bootstrap
     challenge, see the "JACAL" item earlier in this article.

   * `screen'   (SrcCD)

     `screen' is a terminal multiplexer that runs several separate
     "screens" (ttys) on a single character-based terminal.  Each
     virtual terminal emulates a DEC VT100 plus several ISO 2022 and
     ISO 6429 (ECMA 48, ANSI X3.64) functions, including color.
     Arbitrary keyboard input translation is also supported.  `screen'
     sessions can be detached and resumed later on a different terminal
     type.  Output in detached sessions is saved for later viewing.

   * `sed'   (SrcCD)

     `sed' is a stream-oriented version of `ed'.  It comes with the
     `rx' library.

   * Sharutils   (SrcCD)

     `shar' makes so-called shell archives out of many files, preparing
     them for transmission by electronic mail services; `unshar' helps
     unpack these shell archives after reception.  `uuencode' and
     `uudecode' are POSIX compliant implementations of a pair of
     programs which transform files into a format that can be safely
     transmitted across a 7-bit ASCII link.

   * Shellutils   (SrcCD)

     The Shellutils are: `basename', `chroot', `date', `dirname',
     `echo', `env', `expr', `factor', `false', `groups', `hostname',
     `id', `logname', `nice', `nohup', `pathchk', `printenv', `printf',
     `pwd', `seq', `sleep', `stty', `su', `tee', `test', `true', `tty',
     `uname', `uptime', `users', `who', `whoami', & `yes'.

   * Shogi   (SrcCD)

     Shogi is a Japanese game similar to Chess; a major difference is
     that captured pieces can be returned into play.

     GNU Shogi is a variant of GNU Chess; it implements the same
     features & similar heuristics.  As a new feature, sequences of
     partial board patterns can be introduced to help the program play
     toward specific opening patterns.  It has both character and X
     display interfaces.

     It is primarily supported by Matthias Mutz on behalf of the FSF.

   * SIPP    (SrcCD)

     SIPP is a library for photorealisticly rendering 3D scenes.
     Scenes can be illuminated by an arbitrary number of light sources;
     they are built up of object hierarchies, with arbitrarily many
     subobjects and subsurfaces.  Surfaces can be rendered with either
     Phong, Gouraud, or flat shading.  The library supports
     programmable shaders and texture mapping.

   * Smail   (SrcCD)

     Smail is a mail transport system, designed as a compatible drop-in
     replacement for `sendmail'.  It uses a much simpler configuration
     format than `sendmail' and is designed to be setup with minimal
     effort.

   * Smalltalk   *Also *note Forthcoming GNUs::.*   (SrcCD)

     GNU Smalltalk is an interpreted object-oriented programming
     language system written in highly portable C®  It has been ported
     to DOS, many Unix, & other OSes.  Features include a binary image
     save capability, the ability to call user-written C code with
     parameters, an Emacs editing mode, a version of the X protocol
     invocable from Smalltalk, optional byte-code compilation and/or
     execution tracing, & automatically loaded per-user initialization
     files.  It implements all of the classes & protocol in the book
     "Smalltalk-80: The Language", except for the graphic user
     interface (GUI) related classes.

   * SNePS    (SrcCD)

     generate-and-test approach to find the shortest instruction
     sequence for a given function.  You provide a function as input, a
     CPU to generate code for, and how many instructions you want.  Its
     use in GCC is described in the `ACM SIGPLAN PLDI'92 Proceedings'.
     It supports: SPARC, m68k, m68020, m88k, IBM POWER and PowerPC, AMD
     29k, Intel x86 & 960, Pyramid, DEC Alpha, Hitachi SH, & HP-PA.

   * `tar'   (SrcCD)

     GNU `tar' includes multi-volume support, the ability to archive
     sparse files, compression/decompression, remote archives, and
     special features that allow `tar' to be used for incremental and
     full backups.  GNU `tar' uses an early draft of the POSIX 1003.1
     `ustar' format which is different from the final version.  This
     will be corrected in the future.

   * Termcap Library   (SrcCD)   [FSFman]

     The GNU Termcap library is a drop-in replacement for
     `libtermcap.a' on any system.  It does not place an arbitrary
     limit on the size of Termcap entries, unlike most other Termcap

   * `wdiff'   (SrcCD)

     `wdiff' is a front-end to GNU `diff'.  It compares two files,
     finding the words deleted or added to the first to make the
     second.  It has many output formats and works well with terminals
     and pagers.  `wdiff' is very useful when two texts differ only by
     a few words and paragraphs have been refilled.

   * WN   (SrcCD)

     WN is a World Wide Web server designed to be secure and flexible.
     It offers many different capabilities in pre-parsing files before
     passing them to the client, and has a very different design from

   * `xboard', `xshogi'   (SrcCD)

     `xboard' is an X Window interface to GNU Chess.  `xshogi' is an X
     Window interface to GNU Shogi.  They use the R4 Athena widgets and
     Xt Intrinsics to provide an interactive referee for managing a
     game between a user & a computer opponent, or between two
     computers.  You can also use `xboard' without GNU Chess to play
     through games in files or to play through games manually (force
     mode); in this case, moves aren't validated.

   * `xgrabsc'   (SrcCD)

     `xgrabsc' is a screen capture program similar to `xwd' but with a
     graphical user interface, more ways of selecting the part of the

CD-ROMs
*******

We offer these CD-ROMs:

   * Several editions of our *Note Source Code CD-ROMs::.

   * December 1995 *Note Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM::.

   * December 1994 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM, see the *note Free
     Software Foundation Order Form::..

   * December 1993 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM, see the *note Free
     Software Foundation Order Form::..

Our CD-ROMs are in ISO 9660 format and can be mounted as a read-only
file system on most computers.  If your driver supports it, you can
mount each CD with "Rock Ridge" extensions and it will look just like
an ordinary Unix file system, rather than one full of truncated and
otherwise mangled names that fit vanilla ISO 9660.

   You can build most of the software without copying the sources off
the CD.  You only need enough disk space for object files and
intermediate build targets.

    

Pricing of the GNU CD-ROMs
--------------------------

   If a business or organization is ultimately paying, the July 1996
Source CD set costs $240.  The set costs $60 if you, an individual, are
paying out of your own pocket.  The December 1995 Compiler Tools
Binaries CD-ROM costs $220 for a business or organization, and $55 for
an individual.

    

What Do the Different Prices Mean?
..................................

   The software on our disks is free; anyone can copy it and anyone can
run it.  What we charge for is the physical disk and the service of
distribution.

   We charge two different prices depending on who is buying.  When a
company or other organization buys the July 1996 Source CD-ROMs, we
charge $240.  When an individual buys the same CD-ROMs, we charge just
$60.  This distinction is not a matter of who is allowed to use the
software.  In either case, once you have a copy, you can distribute as
many copies as you wish and there's no restriction on who can have or
run them.  The price distinction is entirely a matter of what kind of
entity pays for the CDs.

   You, the reader, are certainly an individual, not a company.  If you
are buying a disk "in person", then you are probably doing so as an
individual.  But if you expect to be reimbursed by your employer, then
the disk is really for the company; so please pay the company price and
get reimbursed for it.  We won't try to check up on you--we use the
honor system--so please cooperate.

   Buying CDs at the company price is very helpful for GNU; just
140 Source CDs at that price support an FSF programmer or tech writer
for a year.

    

Why Is There an Individual Price?
.................................

   In the past, our distribution tapes were ordered mainly by companies.
The CD at the price of $240 provides them with all of our software for a
much lower price than they would previously have paid for six different
tapes.  To lower the price more would cut into the FSF's funds very
badly and decrease the software development we can do.

   However, for individuals, $240 is too high a price; hardly anyone
could afford that.  So we decided to make CDs available to individuals
at the lower price of $60.

    

Is There a Maximum Price?
.........................

   Our stated prices are minimum prices.  Feel free to pay a higher
price if you wish to support GNU development more.  The sky's the
limit; we will accept as high a price as you can offer.  Or simply give
a donation (tax-deductible in the U.S.) to the Free Software
Foundation, a tax-exempt public charity.

    

December 1995 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM
--------------------------------------------

   We have the third edition of our CD-ROM that has binaries and
complete sources for GNU compiler tools for some systems which lack a
compiler.  This enables the people who use these systems to compile GNU
and other free software without having to buy a proprietary compiler.
You can also use these GNU tools to compile your own C/C++/Objective-C
programs.  Older editions of this CD are available while supplies last
at a reduced price; see the *note Free Software Foundation Order
Form::..

   We hope to have more systems on each update of this CD.  If you can
help build binaries for new systems (especially those that don't come
with a C compiler), or have one to suggest, please contact us at the
addresses on the top menu.

These packages:

        * DJGPP 1.12m4 from GCC 2.6.3
        * GCC/G++/Objective-C 2.7.1
        * GNU C Library 1.09
        * GDB 4.15.1
        * Binutils 2.6
        * Bison 1.24
        * Emacs 19.29 (MS-DOS only)
        * Flex 2.5.2
        * Make 3.74
        * libg++ 2.7.1

On these platforms:

        * `i386-msdos'
        * `hppa1.0-hp-hpux9'
        * `sparc-sun-solaris2'
        * `sparc-sun-sunos4.1'

    

MS-DOS/Windows Book with CD-ROM
-------------------------------

   We are working on our first book on GNU Software for DOS/Windows,
but we do not know when it will be finished.  It will include a CD-ROM
with the sources & binaries for much of the GNU software.

   Because it just slows us down, please do NOT contact us about this
book until we announce it on our electronic mailing lists (to
subscribe, ask `info-gnu-request@prep.ai.mit.edu').

    

    

Source Code CD-ROMs
-------------------

   We have several versions of our Source Code CD-ROMs available,
including:

   * *Note July 1996 Source Code CD-ROMs::, the newest release, has
     programs, bug fixes, & improvements not on the other CDs.

   * *Note December 1995 Source Code CD-ROMs::.

   * June 1995 Source Code CD-ROM, see the *note Free Software
     Foundation Order Form::..

   * May 1994 Source Code CD-ROM, see the *note Free Software
     Foundation Order Form::..

   * *Note November 1993 Source Code CD-ROM::.

   * May 1993 Source Code CD-ROM, see the *note Free Software
     Foundation Order Form::..

   * October 1992 Source Code CD-ROM, see the *note Free Software
     Foundation Order Form::..

The older Source CDs are available while supplies last at a reduced
price (please note that the December 1994 Source CD is permanently out
of stock).  All the Source CDs have Texinfo source for the GNU manuals
listed in *Note Documentation::.

   MIT Scheme & much of X11 is *not* on the older Source CDs.

   There are no precompiled programs on these Source CDs.  You will
need a C compiler (programs which need some other interpreter or
compiler normally provide the C source for a bootstrapping program).
We ship C compiler binaries for some systems on the *Note Compiler
Tools Binaries CD-ROM::.

    

July 1996 Source Code CD-ROMs

CD-ROM Subscription Service
***************************

   Our subscription service enables you to stay current with the latest
GNU developments.  For a one-time cost equivalent to three Source
CD-ROMs (plus shipping in some cases), we will ship you four new
versions of the *Note Source Code CD-ROMs::.  The CD-ROMs are sent as
they are issued (currently twice a year, but we hope to make it more
frequent).  We do not yet know if we will be offering subscriptions to
the Compiler Tools Binaries CD or our DOS/Windows Book with CD-ROM when
it is available.

   A subscription is an easy way to keep up with the regular bug fixes
to the X Window System.  Each edition of the *Note Source Code
CD-ROMs::, has updated sources for the X Window System.

   Please note: In two cases, you must pay 4 times the normal shipping
required for a single order when you pay for each subscription.  If
you're in Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico you must add $20.00 for
shipping for each subscription.  If you're outside of the U.S., Canada,
and Puerto Rico, you must add $80.00 for each subscription.  See
"CD-ROMs" and "Tax and Shipping Costs" on the *note Free Software
Foundation Order Form::..

    

FSF T-shirt
***********

   The front of our T-shirt has the GNU Emacs Lisp code `(USE 'GNU)'
with "`()'" being the dancing parentheses from the cover of our `GNU
Emacs Lisp Reference Manual' (drawn by Berkeley, CA artist Etienne
Suvasa).  The shirt's back is imprinted with the Preamble to the GNU
General Public License.

   These shirts come in black, purple, red, pink, burgundy, blue, and
natural (off-white).  When you order, please give 3 choices.  Black and
purple are printed in white; the other colors are printed in black.
All shirts are thick 100% cotton, and come in sizes S, M, L, XL, and
XXL (but they run small so you may want a larger size than usual).

   GNU T-shirts often create spontaneous friendships at conferences &
on university campuses.  They also make great gifts for friends &
family, including children!
