This is a list of the status of GNU Emacs on various machines and systems.
Last updated 21 Mar 1987

Systems:
  For each type of system, the name of the appropriate s- header file
  is given.

Berkeley 4.1 (s-bsd4-1.h)

  Works on vaxes.

Berkeley 4.2 (s-bsd4-2.h)

  Works on several machines.

Berkeley 4.3 (s-bsd4-3.h)

  Works, on Vaxes at least.

System V rel 0 (s-usg5-0.h)

  Works, on Vaxes and 3bxxx's.
  There are some problems in 18.37 due to shortnames/cccp problems:
  use the emacs 17 cpp if you have it.

System V rel 2 (s-usg5-2.h)

  Works on various machines.
  On some (maybe all) machines the library -lPW exists and contains
  a version of `alloca'.  On these machines, to use it, put
     #define HAVE_ALLOCA
     #define LIB_STANDARD -lPW -lc
  in the m-...h file for the machine.

  If you find that the character Meta-DEL makes Emacs crash,
  find where function init_sys_modes in sysdep.c sets sg.c_cc[VQUIT]
  and make it store 7 there.  I have as yet no evidence of whether
  this problem, known in HP-UX, exists in other system V versions.

System V rel 2.2 (s-usg5-2-2.h)

  In 5.2.2 AT&T undid, incompatibly, their previous incompatible
  change to the way the nlist library is called.  A different s- file
  is used to enable the other interface.

  They call themselves the right choice--can't they choose?

  Emacs version 18 unexec is currently not working properly
  on 5.2.2.  Nobody knows why yet.  A workaround is to define
  NO_REMAP.  It is not yet known whether this applies to all
  machines running 5.2.2.

Ultrix

  This is DEC's name for Berkeley 4.2.

Uniplus 5.2 (s-unipl5-2.h)

  Works, on Dual machines at least.

VMS (s-vms.h)

  Works except for certain features (directory listing, dired,
  sending and receiving mail) that use synchronous subprocesses.
  We need people to write alternative implementations of these
  facilities.

  Note that Emacs for VMS is usually distributed
  in a special VMS distribution.  If you are transferring a Unix
  Emacs distribution to VMS, rename all files with `-' in their
  names to have `_` instead, and in file names with more than
  two periods, change all but the last two periods to `_'.

Machines:
  For each type of machine, the names of the m- and s- header files
  are given.

Alliant (m-alliant.h or m-alliant1.h; s-bsd4-2.h)

  18.37 worked with minor changes that are merged into 18.38
  Use m-alliant1.h on version 1 of their operating system
  and use m-alliant.h on version 2.

Altos 3068 (m-altos.h; s-usg5-2.h)

  Changes, very minimal, for 18.36 have been merged in 18.38.

Amdahl UTS (m-amdahl.h; s-usg5-2-2.h)

  Small changes for 18.38 were merged in 18.39.  It is mostly
  working, but at last report a bug sometimes causes Emacs to
  grab very large amounts of memory.  No fix or explanation
  has yet been reported.  It may be possible to find this bug
  if you find which Emacs command it happens within and then
  run that command with a breakpoint set at malloc.

  The 5.2u370 compiler is so brain damaged that it is not
  even worth trying to use it.  Success was obtained with the
  uts native C compiler on uts version 5.2.5.

Apollo running Domain (m-apollo.h; s-bsd4-2.h)

  Works, but it is impossible to dump Emacs; the standard
  Lisp code must be loaded each time Emacs is started.  This
  is a limitation of their operating system.  In other respects
  the system appears to be Berkeley 4.2, and Emacs is told that
  it is running under 4.2.  See the file APOLLO in this directory.
  There are reports of bugs in cc -O on this system.

AT&T 3b2, 3b5, 3b15, 3b20 (m-att3b.h; s-usg5-2-2.h)

  Emacs will probably not work with certain kernel constants too small. 

  In param.h CDLIMIT should be at least (1L << 12) in order to allow 
  processes to write up to 2 Mbyte files.  If it's too small,
  you can perhaps fix it using the file `ulimit.hack' in this directory.

  In seg.h NSEGP and STACKSEG should be at least 16 and 4 respectively
  to allow processes with total size of up to 2Mbytes.
  However, I'm told it is unlikely this would fail to be true.

  The MAXMEM may also prevent Emacs from running.  The file
  3B-MAXMEM in this directory explains how to increase MAXMEM.

AT&T 7300 (m-7300.h; s-usg5-0.h? not sure)

  Changes merged as of 17.57.

Celerity (m-celerity.h; s-bsd4-2.h)

  Works, as of 17.56.  Version 18 has also worked.

Dual running System V (m-dual.h; s-usg5-2.h)

  As of 17.46, this works except for a few changes
  needed in unexec.c.

Dual running Uniplus (m-dual.h; s-unipl5-2.h)

  Works, as of 17.51.

Elxsi 6400 (m-elxsi; s-usg5-2.h)

  18.36 required one small change that's installed in 18.38.

  m-elxsi.h currenty specifies CANNOT_DUMP.
  The Elxsi can in principle dump, but the necessary changes to
  unexec, which involve byte-swapping, were too ugly to install.
  If someone submits simple code that supports dumping on the Elxsi,
  it can be installed and CANNOT_DUMP can be turned off.

Encore machine (m-ns16000.h; s-umax4.2.h)

  This machine bizarrely uses 4.2BSD modified to use the COFF format
  for object files.  Works (as of 18.40).

GEC 93 (m-gec93.h; s-usg5-2.h?)

  Changes are partially merged in version 18, but
  certainly require more work.

Gould (m-gould.h; s-bsd4-2.h or s-bsd4-3.h)

  18.36 worked on versions 1.2 and 2.0 of the operating system.

  On UTX/32 2.0, use s-bsd4-3.h.

  On UTX/32 1.2 and UTX/32S 1.0, use s-bsd4-2.h and note that compiling 
  etc/sorted-doc tickles a compiler bug:  remove the -g flag to cc in the 
  makefile.

  UTX/32 1.3 has a bug in the bcopy library routine.  Fix it by 
  #undef BSTRING in m-gould.h.

HP 9000 series 200 or 300 (m-hp9000.h; s-hpux.h)

  Version 18 works, on HP-UX only.
  Series 200 runs Emacs only if it has the "HP-UX upgrade".
  (Perhaps all series 200 machines running HP-UX have this upgrade?)

  Note that HP has used two incompatible assembler syntaxes,
  and that have recently changed the format of C function frames.
  src/crt0.c and src/alloca.s have been conditionalised for the new
  assembler and new function-entry sequence.  You may need to define
  OLD_HP_ASSEMBLER if you are using an older hpux version.

  The series 500 has a seriously incompatible memory architecture
  which relocates data in memory during execution of a program,
  and support for it would be difficult to implement.

  Define the symbol HPUX_NET if you have the optional network features
  that include the `netunam' system call.

IBM RT/PC (m-ibmrt.h; s-bsd4-2.h or s-usg5-2.h)

  Use s-usg5-2.h (or perhaps s-usg5-2-2.h) for AIX and
  s-bsd-4-2.h for the 4.2-like system.
  18.36 works on the latter; 18.35 fixes for AIX are in 18.37
  but there are reports that it does not run on AIX anyway.

Integrated Solutions `Optimum V' (m-isi-ov.h; s-bsd4-2.h)

  Version 18.27 should work (running on a Optimum V (VME bus, 68020)
  BSD 4.2 (3.05e) system).  Compilation with -O seems to break
  something so don't add it in.  Qbus systems and 68010 systems have
  not been tested.  Also has not been tried on `WorkStation' `Cluster
  Compute Node' `Cluster WorkStation' or `Server Node'  (Love the
  StudLYCaps) 

Masscomp (m-masscomp.h; s-rtu.h)

  18.36 worked on a 5500DP running RTU v3.1a and compiler version 3.2
  with minor fixes that are included in 18.37.  However, bizarre behavior
  was reported for 18.36 on a Masscomp (model and version unknown but probably
  a 68020 system).  The report sounds like a compiler bug.

  GNU Emacs is said to have no chance of compiling on RTU versions
  prior to v3.0.

Megatest (m-mega68.h; s-bsd4-2.h)

  Emacs 15 worked; do not have any reports about Emacs 16 or 17
  but any new bugs are probably not difficult.

Mips (m-mips.h; s-usg5-2.h?)

  Changes merged in 18.39.

NCR Tower 32 (m-tower32.h; s-usg5-2.h)

  Works as of 17.56.

Nixdorf Targon 31 (m-targon31.h; ??)

  m- file for version 17 is included in 18
  but whether it works is not known.
  Note that the "Targon 35" is really a Pyramid.

Nu (TI or LMI) (m-nu.h; s-usg5-2.h)

  Version 18 is believed to work.

Plexus (m-plexus.h; s-usg5-2.h)

  Works as of 17.56.

Pyramid (m-pyramid.h; s-bsd4-2.h)

  In Pyramid system 2.5 there has been a compiler bug making
  Emacs crash just after screen-splitting with Qnil containing 0.
  A compiler that fixes this is Pyramid customer number 8494,
  internal number 1923.

  Some versions of the pyramid compiler get fatal
  errors when the -gx compiler switch is used; if this
  happens to you, change src/m-pyramid.h to define
  C_DEBUG_SWITCH with an empty definition.

Sequent Balance (m-sequent.h; s-bsd4-2.h)

  Emacs 17.52 works in their system version 2.0.
  Emacs has not been tried on their system version 1.3.

Stride (m-stride.h; s-usg5-2.h)

  Works (most recent news for 18.30) on their release 2.0.
  It may be possible to run on their V.1 system but changes
  in the s- file would be needed.

Sun (m-sun1.h, m-sun2.h, m-sun3.h; s-bsd4-2.h)

  There are three m- files for different versions of SunOS.
  All are derived from Berkeley 4.2.  Emacs 17 has run on all of them.
  Whether you should use m-sun1.h, m-sun2.h or m-sun3.h depends
  on the version of the operating system you have.
  You will need to use m-sun3.h on Sun 2's running
  SunOS releases 3 and up.

  If you want to use SunWindows, define HAVE_SUN_WINDOWS
  in config.h to enable a special interface called `emacstool'.
  The definition must *precede* the #include "m-sun3.h".
  System version 3.2 is required for this facility to work.

  We recommend that you instead use the X window system, which
  has technical advantages, is an industry standard, and is also
  free software.

  Note that Emacs on a Sun is not really as big as it looks.
  As dumped, it includes around 200k of zeros between the
  original text section and the original data section
  (now remapped as part of the text).  These are never
  swapped in.

Tahoe (m-tahoe.h; s-bsd4-2.h)

  Works, as of an early version 17.

Tektronix 16000 box (6130?) (m-16000.h; s-bsd4-2.h)

  Emacs 17.61 worked.

Vax running Berkeley Unix (m-vax.h; s-bsd4-1.h, s-bsd4-2.h or s-bsd4-3.h)

  Works.  Note that "ultrix" is essentially 4.2; use s-bsd4-2.h.

Vax running System V rel 2 (m-vax.h; s-usg5-2.h)

  18.27 Works.

Vax running System V rel 0 (m-vax.h; s-usg5-0.h)

  Works as of 18.36.

Vax running VMS (m-vax.h; s-vms.h  but on VMS they are m_vax.h and s_vms.h)

  18.36 believed to work.  Addition of features is necessary to make
  this Emacs version more usable.

Whitechapel MG1 (m-mg1.h, s-?)

  May work.  Supposedly no changes were needed except the m- file.
  I do not know what Unix version runs on them.

Wicat (m-wicat.h; s-usg5-2.h)

  Changes merged as of 18.6; whether they work is unknown.
  See comments in m-wicat.h for things you should change
  depending on the system and compiler version you have.
