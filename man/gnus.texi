@top The GNUS News Reader

@cindex NNTP
You can read netnews within Emacs using the GNUS package.  GNUS uses the
NNTP protocol to communicate with a news server, which is a repository
of news articles.  This need not be the same computer you are logged in
on.

@c  Unlike rrn, GNUS can talk to many NNTP servers easily.  The only thing
@c you have to do is to create startup files for each NNTP server.

While the author of GNUS recommends pronouncing it as ``news'', we
recommend pronouncing it as ``gnoose'', to avoid confusion.

@end table

@node Finding the News
@section Telling GNUS Where To Find the News

Somehow or other, GNUS has to know how to find the current netnews.
Usually this means it has to know the hostname of the NNTP server.

There are several ways that GNUS can get this information.  Most often,
it comes from the environment variable @code{NNTPSERVER}.  You can
specify a default when you install Emacs by setting the variable
@code{gnus-nntp-server} in the @file{site-init.el} file.  If
neither this default nor the environment variable is defined, then GNUS
reads the server name using the minibuffer when you start it.

You can override the default by specifying a prefix argument for the
@code{gnus} command.  Then it always reads the hostname to use.

GNUS can also bypass NNTP and read the news directly from the file
system.  This reduces the overhead, but the features for retrieving by
their message IDs may fail to work (@pxref{Spool Variables}).  To do
this, specify @samp{::} as the NNTP server ``machine name''.

@cindex private news directory
@cindex MH and GNUS
You can also specify a subdirectory of your home directory to use as the
current news spool.  To do this, specify a colon and the subdirectory
name as the NNTP server ``machine name''.  For example, @samp{:Mail}
says to use the directory @file{~/Mail} as the news spool.  This makes
it possible to read mail stored in MH folders or articles saved by GNUS.
The files in the directory with numeric names are considered news
articles, and the other files in the directory are ignored.

  A server specific startup file for each directory must exist before
you start GNUS.  For example, a startup file for the directory
@file{~/Mail} should be a file named @file{.newsrc-:Mail}.
@xref{Startup File}, for more information on the server specific startup
file.@refill

@cindex active file
  Each news server has its own @dfn{active file} which lists the numbers
of the active articles in each newsgroup.  Reading this file from the
server is among the first things GNUS does when it starts.  Commands
such as @kbd{g} that report additional newly-arrived articles work by
rereading the active file.

@vindex gnus-window-configuration
@cindex window configuration
@cindex configure windows
GNUS uses three Emacs buffers: the Newsgroup buffer, the Summary buffer,
and the Article buffer.  Each has its own particular purpose and its own
major mode.  GNUS often displays all three buffers at the same time,
with a configuration you can customize by setting the variable
@code{gnus-window-configuration}.
@ifset gnus
@xref{Variables}, for more
information on customizing the window configuration.
@end ifset

@cindex Article buffer
@cindex Article mode
The @dfn{Article buffer} is where GNUS displays the text of an article.
Its major mode is always @dfn{Article Mode}.  Users rarely select this
buffer because you can read the text while keeping the Summary buffer
selected.

@menu
* Newsgroup Buffer::  A buffer for listing newsgroups.
* Summary Buffer::    A buffer for listing subjects and other important
                        headers. 
@end menu

@node Newsgroup Buffer
@section Newsgroup Buffer
@cindex Newsgroup buffer
@cindex Group mode

  @dfn{Newsgroup buffer} contains a list of newsgroups.  Its major mode
is @dfn{Group Mode}.  This is the first buffer that GNUS displays when
it starts up.

  Normally the list contains only the newsgroups which you subscribe to
and which contain unread articles.  It is normally empty if there is no
such newsgroups.  When you start GNUS, it displays the message @samp{No
news is good news.} in the echo area.

  The format of the Newsgroup buffer looks like this:

@example
@var{s}@var{m}  @var{number}: @var{newsgroup}
@end example

@table @var
@item s
A character indicating whether the newsgroup is subscribed to.  @samp{U}
means you subscribe to the newsgroup; @samp{ } means that you don't.
You can change your subscriptions using commands available in Group
mode.

@item m
A character indicating whether there are newly arrived and unread
articles in the newsgroup.  @samp{*} means there are no newly arrived
articles in the newsgroup.  @samp{ } means there are newly arrived
articles.

@item number
The number of unread articles in the newsgroup.

@item newsgroup
The name of the newsgroup.
@end table

@node Summary Buffer
@section Summary Buffer
@cindex Summary buffer (GNUS)
@cindex Summary mode (GNUS)

  The @dfn{Summary buffer} displays a summary of articles in a single
newsgroup, including their subjects, their numbers, and who posted
them.  Its major mode is Summary mode.  GNUS creates a Summary buffer
for a newsgroup when you select the group in the Newsgroup buffer.

   A Summary buffer contains a line for each article.  Each line looks
like this:

@example
@var{s} @var{number}:@var{c}[@var{lines}:@var{author}] @var{subject}
@end example

Here is what the fields mean:

@table @var
@item s
The status code for this article.  @samp{ } means the article is newly
arrived and never read.  @samp{D} means you read the article already.
@samp{-} means you read it but marked it as saved.

@item number
The number assigned to the article.

@item c
A character indicating which article is currently selected.  @samp{+} is
placed on the current article.@refill

@item lines
The number of lines of the article body.

@item author
The mail address of the author of the article.

@item subject
The subject of the article.
@end table

@vindex gnus-optional-headers
  You can customize the format by setting the variable @code{gnus-optional-headers}.
@ifset gnus
@xref{Variables}, and see @ref{Hooks}, for more information on
customization.
@end ifset

@node Newsgroup Commands
@chapter Newsgroup Commands

  The Newsgroup buffer normally lists the newsgroups which you subscribe
to and which contain unread articles.  But not always---some of the
things you can do display additional newsgroups.  The commands available
in this buffer are mostly concerned with subscribing and unsubscribing.

@menu
* Browsing Newsgroups::         Moving around in the Newsgroup buffer.
* Selecting a Newsgroup::       Selecting a newsgroup to read articles.
* Maintaining Subscriptions::   Subscribing and unsubscribing, etc.

* Other Newsgroup Commands::    Other miscellaneous commands.
@end menu

@node Browsing Newsgroups
@section Browsing Newsgroups

Most of the newsgroup commands operate on the group described by the
current line.  To use them, you need to move the cursor to the group you
want to act on.  You can use ordinary Emacs motion commands, or these
special commands:

@table @kbd
@item n
@kindex n (Group Mode)
@findex gnus-group-next-unread-group
Move point to the next newsgroup containing unread articles
(@code{gnus-group-next-unread-group}).

@item p
@itemx DEL
@kindex p (Group Mode)
@kindex DEL (Group Mode)
@findex gnus-group-prev-unread-group
Move point to the previous newsgroup containing unread articles
(@code{gnus-group-prev-unread-group}).

@itemx C-n
@kindex C-n (Group Mode)
@findex gnus-group-next-group
Move point to the next newsgroup (@code{gnus-group-next-group}).

@itemx C-p
@kindex C-p (Group Mode)
@findex gnus-group-prev-group
Move point to the previous newsgroup (@code{gnus-group-prev-group}).

@item j @var{newsgroup} RET
@kindex j (Group Mode)
@findex gnus-group-jump-to-group
Move point to the @var{newsgroup} specified by name
(@code{gnus-group-jump-to-group}).

@item <
@kindex < (Group Mode)
Move point to the beginning of the buffer (@code{beginning-of-buffer}).

@item >
@kindex > (Group Mode)
Move point to the end of the buffer (@code{end-of-buffer}).

@item r
@kindex r (Group Mode)
@findex gnus-group-restrict-groups
@cindex restrict newsgroups
Restrict visible newsgroups to the current region specified by point
and the mark (@code{gnus-group-restrict-groups}).
@end table

@kindex j (Group Mode)
@findex gnus-group-jump-to-group
  The command @kbd{j} (@code{gnus-group-jump-to-group}) reads a
newsgroup name interactively, and moves point to it.  If there is no
such newsgroup in the buffer, a line for the newsgroup is inserted at
the beginning of the buffer.

@kindex r (Group Mode)
@kindex C-x w
@findex gnus-group-restrict-groups
@findex widen
@cindex restrict newsgroups
  The command @kbd{r} (@code{gnus-group-restrict-groups}) restricts
visibility in the Newsgroup buffer to the region specified by point and
mark.  It is not quite the same as @kbd{C-x n}; it includes all of the
line that the region starts in, and all of the line that the region ends
in.  Type @kbd{C-x w} (@code{widen}) to widen visibility to the whole
buffer.

@node Selecting a Newsgroup
@section Selecting a Newsgroup
@cindex select newsgroup

@kindex SPC (Group Mode)
@findex gnus-group-read-group
@kindex = (Group Mode)
@findex gnus-group-select-group
  To start reading the articles in a newsgroup, move to that newsgroup
in the Newsgroup buffer and type @kbd{SPC}
(@code{gnus-group-read-group}) or @kbd{=}
(@code{gnus-group-select-group}).

@table @kbd

@end table

@ignore
@kindex SPC (Group Mode)
@findex gnus-group-read-group
@vindex gnus-auto-select-first
@vindex gnus-select-group-hook
  To prevent automatic selection of the first unread article even when
the newsgroup is selected by the command @kbd{SPC}
(@code{gnus-group-read-group}), set the variable
@code{gnus-auto-select-first} to @code{nil}.  If you want to change the
value of the variable according to the selected newsgroups, set the
variable in the hook @code{gnus-select-group-hook}.
@end ignore

@kindex SPC (Group Mode)
@findex gnus-group-read-group
@kindex = (Group Mode)
@findex gnus-group-select-group
@cindex select all articles
@cindex read all articles
  Normally, when you select a newsgroup, GNUS prepares to read only the
unread articles (including saved articles).  If the newsgroup has no
unread articles and you select it anyway, GNUS prepares to read all the
articles.  You can force GNUS to include all the articles by giving a
prefix argument to the commands @kbd{SPC} and @kbd{=}
(@code{gnus-group-read-group} and @code{gnus-group-select-group}).

@vindex gnus-large-newsgroup
@cindex large newsgroup
  If the number of articles being selected is larger than the variable
@code{gnus-large-newsgroup}, GNUS prompts for the number of articles to
prepare.  If your answer @var{n} is positive, GNUS prepares the last
@var{n} articles.  If @var{n} is negative, GNUS prepares the first
@minus{}@var{n} articles.  If you answer with the empty string, GNUS
prepares all articles.

(@code{gnus-group-list-all-groups}).

@item u
@kindex u (Group Mode)
@findex gnus-group-unsubscribe-current-group
@cindex subscribe newsgroups
@cindex unsubscribe newsgroups
Unsubscribe from (or subscribe to) the newsgroup
(@code{gnus-group-unsubscribe-current-group}).

@item U @var{newsgroup} RET
@kindex U (Group Mode)
@findex gnus-group-unsubscribe-group
@cindex subscribe newsgroups
@cindex unsubscribe newsgroups
Unsubscribe from (or subscribe to) the newsgroup named @var{newsgroup}
(@code{gnus-group-unsubscribe-group}).

@item C-k
@kindex C-k (Group Mode)
@findex gnus-group-kill-group
@cindex kill newsgroups
Kill the newsgroup line that point is in
(@code{gnus-group-kill-group}).
  
@item C-w
@kindex C-w (Group Mode)
@findex gnus-group-kill-region
@cindex kill newsgroups
Kill newsgroups in current region (excluding current line)
(@code{gnus-group-kill-region}).

@item C-y
@kindex C-y (Group Mode)
@findex gnus-group-yank-group
@cindex yank newsgroups
Yank the last newsgroup killed (@code{gnus-group-yank-group}).  It is
inserted just before the current line.  Successive uses of @kbd{C-y}
yank earlier kills, in last-in first-out order.
  
@item C-x C-t
@kindex C-x C-t (Group Mode)
@findex gnus-group-transpose-groups
Exchange current newsgroup and previous newsgroup.
(@code{gnus-group-transpose-groups}).@refill

@item M-x gnus-list-killed-groups
@findex gnus-list-killed-groups
@c !!! I think this key binding is useful.
@item C-c C-l
@kindex C-c C-l (Group Mode)
Display a list of the newsgroups you have killed.  This is so you can
copy them back into the startup file.

@item b
@kindex b (Group Mode)
@findex gnus-group-check-bogus-groups
Delete bogus newsgroups (@code{gnus-group-check-bogus-groups}).

@item g
@kindex g (Group Mode)
@findex gnus-group-get-new-news
@cindex active file
Get newly arrived articles for all groups
(@code{gnus-group-get-new-news}).
@end table

@cindex catch up
@cindex cross-references
@cindex Xref field
  The commands @kbd{c} and @kbd{C} (@code{gnus-group-catchup} and
@code{gnus-group-catchup-all}) mark all or most of the articles in a
newsgroup as read.  They are useful if you have been away from news
reading for a while, and you don't want to slog through the backlog of
old postings.  These commands do not take account of the cross-reference
information in the @samp{Xref:} field, while the @kbd{c} command in
Summary Mode does.

  Only subscribed newsgroups containing unread and saved articles are usually
displayed in the Newsgroup buffer.  Type @kbd{L}
(@code{gnus-group-list-all-groups}) to show all newsgroups which are
currently active.  Use @kbd{l} (@code{gnus-group-list-groups}) to go
back to the usual contents---only groups which have news for you to
read.

@cindex options -n in startup file
@cindex add newsgroups
@cindex new newsgroups
  The command @kbd{U} (@code{gnus-group-unsubscribe-group}) reads a
newsgroup name interactively, and toggles its subscription flag.  This
is the usual way to subscribe to new groups.  (You can also type @kbd{L}
and then use @kbd{u} on the groups you want to read.)  You can also
arrange to subscribe automatically to some or all newly created
newsgroups using the options line in your startup file, @file{~/.newsrc}.
@xref{Startup File}, for more information.

@cindex kill newsgroups
@cindex yank newsgroups
@cindex order of newsgroups
@cindex change the order of newsgroups
@c ??? How does killing relate to unsubscribing?
  The command @kbd{C-k} (@code{gnus-group-kill-group}) kills a newsgroup
from both the Newsgroup buffer and the raw startup file.  If you change
your mind, type @kbd{C-y} (@code{gnus-group-yank-group}); this yanks the
last newsgroup killed with the @kbd{C-k} command.

  The command @kbd{C-c C-l} (@code{gnus-list-killed-groups}) pops up a buffer listing
the newsgroups you have killed.  You can yank any of these newsgroups by
moving point to the entry for the newsgroup you want, and then typing
@kbd{y} or @kbd{C-y} (@code{gnus-browse-killed-yank}).  So a convenient
way to change the order of newsgroups is to kill some of them, then go
to the list of killed groups and yank them in the order you want.

  You are not limited to yanking only the groups that you killed in the
current GNUS session.  All the groups you have ever killed are
remembered in the quick startup file, and you can restore them any time
unless you lose the file.

@cindex bogus newsgroups
@cindex delete newsgroups
  A @dfn{bogus newsgroup} is one not in the list of active newsgroups in
the active file.  Type @kbd{b} (@code{gnus-group-check-bogus-groups}) to
delete all the bogus newsgroups that you subscribe to.  Bogus newsgroups
that you have unsubscribed or killed are deleted also.

@kindex g (Group Mode)
@findex gnus-group-get-new-news
@cindex active file
  The @kbd{g} command rereads the active file to get updated lists of
articles available to be read.

@node Exiting GNUS

@chapter Summary Commands

  The Summary buffer shows you a summary of the contents of a single
newsgroup, with one line for each article.  You can move around in the
Summary buffer, giving commands to view articles, save them, reply to
them, and so on.  When you view an article, its text appears in
a separate buffer, but the Summary buffer remains current.  In fact,
there is hardly ever a reason to select the Article buffer; you can
do almost all news reading tasks while staying in the Summary buffer.

(@code{gnus-summary-caesar-message}).
@end table

@kindex = (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-expand-window
  The command @kbd{=} (@code{gnus-summary-expand-window}) expands the
Summary window by deleting the Article window.  Use it when you want to
concentrate on the Summary buffer.  This command is different from
@kbd{C-x 1} when more than two windows exist.

@cindex rot 13/47
@cindex caesar messages
@cindex encrypted articles
@kindex C-c C-r (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-caesar-message
  The command @kbd{C-c C-r} (@code{gnus-summary-caesar-message}) rotates
all letters in the body of the current article by 13/47 places.  (This
encoding is often called ``rot 13''.)  To undo this operation, run it a
second time.
@c Japanese characters are rotated by 47 places.

@vindex gnus-break-pages
@cindex pages (GNUS)
@cindex break into pages (GNUS)
  If an article contains multiple pages, GNUS normally displays just one
page at a time.  To advance to the next page of an article, simply type
@key{SPC}.  It advances to the next page whenever the end of a page is
on the screen.

@kindex w (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-stop-page-breaking
  The command @kbd{w} (@code{gnus-summary-stop-page-breaking})
temporarily suspends page breaking; it makes the entire current article
visible.  You can turn off page breaking all the time by setting the
variable @code{gnus-break-pages} to @code{nil}.

@vindex gnus-page-delimiter
  Page boundaries are defined by the variable
@code{gnus-page-delimiter}, whose value is a regular expression.  The
default is to match a formfeed character at the beginning of a line.

@kindex t (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-toggle-header
@vindex gnus-ignored-headers
  GNUS normally hides many uninteresting header fields when it displays
an article.  (The variable @code{gnus-ignored-headers} controls which
fields are ignored.)  If you want to see the whole header, type @code{t}
(@code{gnus-summary-toggle-header}).  Use @kbd{t} a second time to hide
the uninteresting header fields again.

  If the variable @code{gnus-auto-extend-newsgroup} is non-@code{nil},
the commands @kbd{N} and @kbd{P} (@code{gnus-summary-next-article} and
@code{gnus-summary-prev-article}) extend visible articles to forward and
backward if possible.  The Summary buffer normally displays just a
subset of the extant articles; extending the buffer means that if you
try to move forward from the last article shown, it looks for later
articles that are not shown, and puts them into the buffer so you can
move to them.

@vindex gnus-auto-select-next
  The variable @code{gnus-auto-select-next} defines the behavior of GNUS
when there is no unread article in the current newsgroup and a command
selecting the next unread article is executed.  If the variable is
non-@code{nil}, the next newsgroup containing unread articles is
selected automatically.

@node Marking Articles
@subsection Marking Articles
@cindex article status
@cindex mark articles

  GNUS uses single-character marks to indicate the status of an
article.

@table @asis
@item @samp{ } (a space)
@cindex newly arrived article
A newly arrived article.

@item @samp{-}
@cindex saved article
An article marked as saved.

@item @i{anything else}
An article marked as read.
@end table

@noindent
@cindex unread article
Both newly arrived articles and saved articles are considered
@dfn{unread}.

  The status is displayed at the beginning of each line of the Summary
buffer.  Here are some commands for changing these marks:

@table @kbd
@item d
@kindex d (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-mark-as-read-forward
Mark this line's article as read, then move point to the following line
(@code{gnus-summary-mark-as-read-forward}).  This and the following similar
commands do not select an article; they only move point in the Summary
buffer.

@item u
@kindex u (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-mark-as-unread-forward
Mark this line's article as saved, then move point to the following line
(@code{gnus-summary-mark-as-unread-forward}).

@item M-u
@kindex M-u (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-clear-mark-forward
Clear marks on this line's article, then move point to the next line
(@code{gnus-summary-clear-mark-forward}).  This sets the status to
``newly arrived''.

@item D
@item U
@item M-U
@kindex D (Summary Mode)
@kindex U (Summary Mode)
@kindex M-U (Summary Mode)
Analogous to @kbd{d}, @kbd{u} and @kbd{M-u}, except that they move
backwards instead of forwards in the Summary buffer.

@item k
@kindex k (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-kill-same-subject-and-select
Mark as read all articles with the same subject as the current article,
then select the next unread article
(@code{gnus-summary-kill-same-subject-and-select}).  Use this when you
decide a certain discussion is not interesting.

@item C-k
@kindex C-k (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-kill-same-subject
Mark as read all articles with the same subject as the current article
(@code{gnus-summary-kill-same-subject}).

@item c
@kindex c (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-catchup-and-exit
@cindex catch up
Mark all newly arrived articles as read; then exit the current newsgroup
(@code{gnus-summary-catchup-and-exit}).  This does not change the
status of articles that are saved.

@item M-x gnus-summary-catchup-all-and-exit
@findex gnus-summary-catchup-all-and-exit
@cindex catch up
Mark all articles (including saved articles) as read, and then exit the
current newsgroup.

@item M-x gnus-summary-catchup
@findex gnus-summary-catchup
@cindex catch up
Mark all newly arrived articles as read, but don't alter saved
articles.

@item M-x gnus-summary-catchup-all
@findex gnus-summary-catchup-all
@cindex catch up
Mark all articles as read.

@item x
@kindex x (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-delete-marked-as-read
Delete summary lines for articles marked as read
(@code{gnus-summary-delete-marked-as-read}).

@item X @var{marks} RET
@kindex X (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-delete-marked-with
Delete headers marked with any of @var{marks}
(@code{gnus-summary-delete-marked-with}).
@end table

@kindex x (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-delete-marked-as-read
@kindex X (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-delete-marked-with
@cindex large newsgroup
  You can make it easier to see the remaining unread articles in the
Summary buffer by deleting the lines describing the already read
articles.  To do this, use the command @kbd{x}
(@code{gnus-summary-delete-marked-as-read}).  The command @kbd{X}
(@code{gnus-summary-delete-marked-with}) deletes headers which have
certain specified marks.  Thus, @kbd{X D - @key{RET}} deletes all
articles marked with @samp{D} or @samp{-}---which is to say, all read
and saved articles.  (There are no spaces in that command; we inserted
spaces for clarity when showing it here.)

@node Thread-based Reading
@subsection Reading Based on Conversation Threads
@cindex threads (in GNUS)
@cindex references between articles

  A @dfn{thread} is defined as a set of articles related by
cross-reference.  These references make use of header fields
@samp{References:} and @samp{In-Reply-To:}, which cite the message ID of
another article.

  Conversations in a newsgroup usually contain several threads under a
single subject.  This makes it difficult to know which article follows
which without reading references directly.  You can use the thread-based
commands to do this automatically.  You can follow threads of
conversation, mark entire threads as read, and go up and down thread
trees.

@kindex M-C-t (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-toggle-threads
  The command @kbd{M-C-t} (@code{gnus-summary-toggle-threads}) toggles
showing conversation threads in Summary mode.  If it is turned on,
Summary buffer is displayed in a tree structured form which shows the
thread structure.

@table @kbd
@item C-M-t
@kindex C-M-t (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-toggle-threads
Toggle thread-based reading
(@code{gnus-summary-toggle-threads}).

@item C-M-s 
@kindex C-M-s (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-show-thread
Show the thread subtree of the current line
(@code{gnus-summary-show-thread}).

@findex gnus-summary-show-all-threads
Show all thread subtrees.

@item C-M-h
@kindex C-M-h (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-hide-thread
Hide the thread subtrees of the current line
(@code{gnus-summary-hide-thread}).

@item M-x gnus-summary-hide-all-threads
@findex gnus-summary-hide-all-threads
Hide all thread subtrees.

@item C-M-f
@kindex C-M-f (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-next-thread
Go to the next thread at the same level
(@code{gnus-summary-next-thread}).

@item C-M-b
@kindex C-M-b (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-prev-thread
Go to the previous thread at the same level
(@code{gnus-summary-prev-thread}).

@item C-M-d
@kindex C-M-d (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-down-thread
Go down to next thread subordinate to the current line.
(@code{gnus-summary-down-thread}).

@item C-M-u
@kindex C-M-u (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-up-thread
Go up to the parent thread of the current line
(@code{gnus-summary-up-thread}).

@item C-M-k
@kindex C-M-k (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-kill-thread
Mark all articles under current thread as read
(@code{gnus-summary-kill-thread}).
@end table

@c ??? Unclear
@kindex C-M-h (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-hide-thread
@kindex C-M-s (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-show-thread
  Thread subtrees can be hidden by using the command @kbd{C-M-h}
(@code{gnus-summary-hide-thread}), and the hidden subtrees can be shown
by using the command @kbd{C-M-s}
(@code{gnus-summary-show-thread}).

@vindex gnus-thread-hide-killed
@kindex C-M-k (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-kill-thread
  If the variable @code{gnus-thread-hide-killed} is non-@code{nil},
thread subtrees killed by the command @kbd{C-M-k}
(@code{gnus-summary-kill-thread}) are hidden automatically.

@vindex gnus-thread-hide-subtree
  If you want to hide thread subtrees initially, set the variable
@code{gnus-thread-hide-subtree} to non-@code{nil}.

@vindex gnus-show-threads
  If you want to enable thread-based reading automatically, set the
variable @code{gnus-show-threads} to non-@code{nil}.

@node Digest Articles
@subsection Reading Digest Articles
@cindex digest articles

  @dfn{Digest article} is a message containing many messages in
@dfn{digest} format.  Since a digest article contains many messages in
one article, it is a little bit difficult to read it on a per message
basis.  The following commands make it easier to read each message in a
digest.

@table @kbd
@item C-c C-n
@kindex C-c C-n (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-next-digest
Scroll to the next digest message of the current article
(@code{gnus-summary-next-digest}).

@item C-c C-p
@kindex C-c C-p (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-prev-digest
Scroll to the previous digest message of the current article
(@code{gnus-summary-prev-digest}).

@item C-d
@kindex C-d (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-rmail-digest
@cindex Rmail
Read the current digest article using Rmail
(@code{gnus-summary-rmail-digest}).
@end table

@kindex C-c C-n (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-next-digest
@kindex C-c C-p (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-prev-digest
@vindex gnus-digest-separator
@cindex digest separator
  The commands @kbd{C-c C-n} and @kbd{C-c C-p}
(@code{gnus-summary-next-digest} and @code{gnus-summary-prev-digest})
scroll a digest article to the next and previous digested message,
respectively.  The variable @code{gnus-digest-separator} specifies a
regexp which separates digested messages.

@kindex C-d (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-rmail-digest
@vindex gnus-select-article-hook
@cindex Rmail
  The command @kbd{C-d} (@code{gnus-summary-rmail-digest}) runs Rmail on
a digest article and makes it possible to read messages not in digest
form using Rmail Mode.  @xref{Rmail,,, emacs, The GNU Emacs Manual}, for
more information on Rmail Mode.  Use the hook
@code{gnus-select-article-hook} to run Rmail on digest articles
automatically.

@vindex gnus-select-digest-hook
@cindex incomplete digest articles
  Some newsgroups use a digest format that cannot be read using Rmail.
In this case, @kbd{C-d} displays @samp{Article is not a digest} in the
echo area.  It is, however, possible to read these incomplete digest
articles by modifying the message headers or bodies appropriately using
the hook @code{gnus-select-digest-hook}.  @xref{Hooks}, to modify
incomplete digest articles.

@vindex gnus-digest-show-summary
@cindex digest summary
@cindex summary of digest
  If the variable @code{gnus-digest-show-summary} is non-@code{nil}, a
summary of the digest article is also displayed automatically when Rmail
is invoked.

@node Searching Articles
@section Searching Articles
@cindex search for articles

@table @kbd
@item s
@kindex s (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-isearch-article
Do incremental search on the current article

@item M-s @var{regexp} RET
@kindex M-s (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-search-article-forward
Search for articles containing a match for @var{regexp} forward
(@code{gnus-summary-search-article-forward}).  If @var{regexp} is empty,
the last regexp used is used again.

@c !!! M-S moved to M-r
@item M-r @var{regexp} RET
@kindex M-r (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-search-article-backward
Search for articles containing a match for @var{regexp} backward

@var{field} is empty, the entire article is searched for.
@end table

@kindex s (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-isearch-article
@kindex M-s (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-search-article-forward
@kindex M-r (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-search-article-backward
  The command @kbd{s} (@code{gnus-summary-isearch-article}) does an
incremental search on the current article.  This is like switching to
the Article buffer and typing @kbd{C-s} except that the Summary buffer
remains selected.  The command @kbd{M-s}
(@code{gnus-summary-search-article-forward}) searches for articles
containing a match for regexp.  The search starts from the current point
of the current article.  To search backwards, use the command @kbd{M-r}
(@code{gnus-summary-search-article-backward}).@refill

@kindex & (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-execute-command
  The command @kbd{&} (@code{gnus-summary-execute-command})
interactively reads a header field name, a regular expression, and a
valid key sequence.  It then searches for all articles in which that
regular expression matches the contents of the specified header field.
It executes the key sequence in each such message.

@node Referencing Articles
@section Referencing Articles
@cindex refer to articles

@table @kbd
@item ^
@kindex ^ (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-refer-parent-article
Refer to parent of the current article in terms of the @samp{References}
field (@code{gnus-summary-refer-parent-article}).  With a prefix
argument, go back to the child.

@item M-^ @var{Message-ID} RET
@kindex M-^ (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-refer-article
Refer to the article by using the @var{Message-ID}
(@code{gnus-summary-refer-article}).
@end table

@kindex ^ (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-refer-parent-article
  The command @kbd{^} (@code{gnus-summary-refer-parent-article}) refers
to parent article of the current article.  You can go back to the child
article with @kbd{C-u ^}.

  @kbd{^} and @kbd{M-^} select a new article without moving point in the
Summary buffer.  As a consequence, you can use @kbd{g} to go back to the
article in which you started the last sequence of @kbd{^} and @kbd{M-^}
commands.

  You can use the @kbd{r} command in Article mode to follow a reference
contained in the text of an article.  @xref{Article Commands}.

@node Saving Articles
@section Saving Articles
@cindex save articles

  GNUS supports four different formats for saving articles: Rmail
format, Unix mailbox format, MH folder, and article format.

@table @kbd
@item o
@kindex o (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-save-article
Save the current article in Rmail format
(@code{gnus-summary-save-article}).

@item C-o
@kindex C-o (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-save-in-mail
Save the current article in Unix mail file format
(@code{gnus-summary-save-in-mail}).

@item | @var{command} RET
@kindex | (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-pipe-output
Send contents of the current article through a pipe to a subprocess
running @var{command} (@code{gnus-summary-pipe-output}).
@end table

  The variable @code{gnus-default-article-saver} controls the formats
used by the @kbd{o} command.  By default, it uses Rmail format.  If you
set the variable to @code{gnus-summary-save-in-folder}, @kbd{o} uses MH
format.  If you set it to @code{gnus-summary-save-in-file}, @kbd{o}
saves the article text verbatim.  The default value is
@code{gnus-summary-save-in-rmail}.  (All three of these values are
commands that you can bind to other keys.)

@vindex gnus-article-save-directory
@cindex @code{SAVEDIR} environment variable
  The variable @code{gnus-article-save-directory} specifies the default
directory for saving articles.  If you don't set this variable
explicitly, it is initialized from the @code{SAVEDIR} environment
variable, or, as a last resort, @file{~/News}.

@ifset GNUS
@vindex gnus-mail-save-name
@vindex gnus-rmail-save-name
@vindex gnus-folder-save-name
@vindex gnus-file-save-name
  The variables @code{gnus-mail-save-name}, @code{gnus-rmail-save-name},

@node Sorting Headers
@section Sorting Headers
@cindex sort headers

  GNUS can sort the Summary buffer by number, subject, date, or author
of articles.

@table @kbd
@itemx C-c C-s C-n
@kindex C-c C-s C-n (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-sort-by-number
Sort the headers by number (@code{gnus-summary-sort-by-number}).

@itemx C-c C-s C-s
@kindex C-c C-s C-s (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-sort-by-subject

@itemx C-c C-s C-d
@kindex C-c C-s C-d (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-sort-by-date
Sort the headers by date (@code{gnus-summary-sort-by-date}).

@itemx C-c C-s C-a
@kindex C-c C-s C-a (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-sort-by-author
Sort the headers by author (@code{gnus-summary-sort-by-author}).
@end table

  Sorting is @dfn{stable}, which means that it does not disturb the
relative order of articles whose sort keys are equal.  So you can sort
on multiple keys by using several sort commands in a row; the last sort
command specifies the most powerful sort key.  Thus, @kbd{C-c C-s C-a
C-c C-s C-d C-c C-s C-n} sorts by author, and sorts the messages for
each author by date, and any messages with the same author and date are
sorted by number.

  To sort in reverse order, give a prefix argument to the sort commands.
@vindex gnus-select-group-hook
  It is also possible to sort the headers automatically when a newsgroup
is selected using the hook @code{gnus-select-group-hook}
(@pxref{Hooks}).

@node Article Commands
@chapter Article Commands

GNUS displays one article at a time, in a buffer called the Article
buffer.  When you select an article, GNUS puts the Article buffer on the
screen and displays the article there.

@vindex gnus-window-configuration
  If the Article buffer is not visible, it appears on the screen
whenever you select an article for display.  You can specify the height
of the Article buffer as a fraction of the screen height by setting the
variable @code{gnus-window-configuration}.

The Article buffer has a special major mode, Article mode.  It provides
these commands:

@table @kbd

@node Startup File
@chapter The Startup File
@cindex startup file
@cindex quick startup file
@cindex raw startup file
@cindex .newsrc

Each user who reads news has a file called the @dfn{startup file} which
records which groups he or she subscribes to and which articles have
been read.

GNUS actually uses two startup files that contain the same information.
The @dfn{raw} startup file, named @file{~/.newsrc}, is the master copy
of the information; this is the same file that other news readers use,
and it is kept in the standard format.  The @dfn{quick} startup file
contains the same information in a format convenient for Lisp to read.
GNUS automatically updates the quick startup file from the raw startup
file whenever the latter is newer; but normally it saves time by reading
only the quick startup file.

These commands in Group mode operate on the startup files:

@table @kbd
@item R
@kindex R (Group Mode)
@findex gnus-group-restart
Restart GNUS, using the raw startup file instead of the quick one, and
get newly arrived articles (@code{gnus-group-restart}).

@node Kill File
@chapter Kill File
@cindex Kill file

  A @dfn{kill} file contains lisp expressions to be applied to a

basis of some set of regexps.

@cindex global kill file
@cindex local kill file
  There are two kinds of kill files, global and local.  A global kill
file is applied to every newsgroup, and a local kill file to a specified
newsgroup.

@node Making a Kill File
@section Making a Kill File

  A kill file is simply a file of Lisp code that is loaded (i.e.,
evaluated) while the Summary buffer is current.  In order to work
properly, the contents of the file must be designed to interact properly
with GNUS.  To make it easier to write a valid kill file, GNUS provides
a general function which does the things users typically want to do in a
kill file.

@example
(gnus-kill @var{field} @var{regexp} &optional @var{command} @var{all})
@end example

@findex gnus-kill
@noindent
The @code{gnus-kill} function performs an action on each article that
matches a specified condition.

The two required arguments specify the condition.  The argument
@var{field} specifies a portion of an article; it is either the name of
a header field to search, or @code{""}, which says to search the entire
article body.  The argument @var{regexp} says what to search for.  The
condition is this: an article is eligible if the specified portion of
the article contains a match for @var{regexp}.

The argument @var{command} says what to do when an article fits the
condition.  It is either a valid key sequence in Summary mode, or a Lisp
expression which is a list, or @code{nil}.  A key sequence stands for
its command definition in Summary mode; it means to execute that
command.  A Lisp expression means to evaluate that expression.
@code{nil} says to mark the article with the character @samp{X}.

If @var{all} is omitted or @code{nil}, @code{gnus-kill} checks only
newly arrived articles for meeting the condition.  If @var{all} is
non-@code{nil}, it checks all articles.

Here as an example is how to mark all articles whose subjects contain
the string @samp{AI}:

@example
(gnus-kill "Subject" "AI")
@end example

  If you want to mark articles with @samp{D} instead of @samp{X}, you
can use the following expression, which works by executing the @kbd{d}
command.

@example
(gnus-kill "Subject" "AI" "d")
@end example

The usual aim of a kill file is to delete certain articles.  The way to
do this is to mark them with @samp{X} and then call
@code{gnus-expunge}, like this:

@findex gnus-expunge
@example
(gnus-expunge "X")
@end example

@code{gnus-expunge} takes one argument, a string containing a number of
mark characters, and deletes all the lines that are marked with any of
those characters.

It works to use @code{gnus-expunge} for the marker @samp{D}, but you may
not like what it does, because this prevents you from ever rereading an
article marked as read in a previous session.  That's why the default
marker for @code{gnus-kill} is @samp{X} rather than @samp{D}.

Searching in the Summary buffer normally ignores case; this includes the
searching inside of @code{gnus-kill}.  If you do not want to ignore the
case, set the variable @code{case-fold-search} to @code{nil}.
@c ??? xref needed here 

After GNUS has finished applying the appropriate kill files, if the
newsgroup has no articles left, GNUS exits that newsgroup right away.

@node Editing Kill Files
@section Editing Kill Files

You can use these GNUS commands to find a kill file for editing:

@table @kbd
@item M-k
@kindex M-k (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-edit-local-kill
@cindex edit local KILL file
Edit a local KILL file applied to the current newsgroup
(@code{gnus-summary-edit-local-kill}). 

@item M-K
@kindex M-K (Summary Mode)
@findex gnus-summary-edit-global-kill
@cindex edit global KILL file
Edit a global KILL file applied to all newsgroups
(@code{gnus-summary-edit-global-kill}).  
@end table

@noindent
The same key sequences (@kbd{M-k} and @kbd{M-K}) are available in Group
mode also, but the commands that implement them are
@code{gnus-group-edit-local-kill} and
@code{gnus-group-edit-global-kill}.

@cindex Kill-File mode
  The major mode of these buffers is Kill-File mode, which is like Emacs
Lisp mode but with the following additional commands:

@table @kbd
@item C-c C-k C-s
@kindex C-c C-k C-s (Kill-File Mode)
@findex gnus-kill-file-kill-by-subject

(@code{gnus-kill-file-kill-by-author}).

@item C-c C-a
@kindex C-c C-a (Kill-File Mode)
@findex gnus-kill-file-apply-buffer
Evaluate the whole current buffer, but do so with the Summary buffer
current (@code{gnus-kill-file-apply-buffer}).  This is a convenient way
to try out a kill file you have been editing.

@item C-c C-e
@kindex C-c C-e (Kill-File Mode)
@findex gnus-kill-file-apply-last-sexp

@findex gnus-kill-file-kill-by-author
The effects of @kbd{C-c C-k C-s} and @kbd{C-c C-k C-a} depend on how you
began editing the kill file.  If you gave the command @kbd{M-k} or
@kbd{M-K} while in the Summary buffer, then the article that was current
at that time supplies the string to search for, from its own subject or
author.

@node Kill File Example
@section Example of a Kill File

  This is a real example of a local kill file for newsgroup
@samp{control}.

      (gnus-kill "Subject" "cancel\\|newgroup\\|rmgroup" "d")

@end example

@node Names of Kill Files
@section Names of Kill Files

@vindex gnus-article-save-directory
@vindex gnus-kill-file-name
Kill files are kept in the directory specified by the variable
@code{gnus-article-save-directory}; its default value is @file{~/News}.
The variable @code{gnus-kill-file-name} specifies the global kill file's
name within that directory; the default is @file{KILL}.

@vindex gnus-use-long-file-name
The name of a local kill file is based on the newsgroup's name.  If the
variable @code{gnus-use-long-file-name} is non-@code{nil}, then the file
name is @file{@var{newsgroup}.KILL}.  Otherwise, it is
@file{@var{news}/@var{group}/KILL}, where the subdirectory name is made
from the newsgroup name by changing all periods to slashes.

@node Background Kills
@section Background Kill Processing
@cindex batch kill processing

  Kill processing can take a long time.  If you don't want to wait for
it, try background kill processing using the following shell command:

@findex gnus-batch-kill
@example
emacs -batch -l gnus -f gnus-batch-kill @var{newsgroups}@dots{}
@end example

@noindent
where @var{newsgroups} are newsgroup names separated by whitespace.
@samp{!} preceding a newsgroup name means negation, and @samp{all}
specifies all newsgroups not yet decided.  These interpretations are the
same as the options line of the startup file (@pxref{Startup File}).

@node Advanced Kills
@section Advanced Kill Processing

@findex gnus-apply-kill-file
@vindex gnus-apply-kill-hook
  Internally, applying kills means to run the hook
@code{gnus-apply-kill-hook}.  It is called after the Summary buffer is
prepared for a selected newsgroup.  The default hook is the function
@code{gnus-apply-kill-file} which loads a global kill file and a local
kill file in this order.  A different style of the kill processing can
be implemented by customizing this hook.

  For example, if you don't have a global kill file, you can
use the following hook which applies only a local kill file.  This
change can save the time for checking the existence of a global kill
file.

@vindex gnus-newsgroup-name
@findex gnus-newsgroup-kill-file
@example
;; @r{Get rid of the default hook.}
(setq gnus-apply-kill-hook nil)
(add-hook 'gnus-apply-kill-hook
  '(lambda ()
     ;; Apply a local kill file.
     (load (gnus-newsgroup-kill-file gnus-newsgroup-name) t nil t)))
@end example

@noindent
(As usual, you can put as many functions as you wish into this hook.
What is not usual is the fact that the hook is not initially empty.
Therefore, if you don't want the default hook value, you must set the
hook variable to @code{nil}.)

  In contrast, the following example enables only a global kill file.

@example
;; @r{Get rid of the default hook.}
(setq gnus-apply-kill-hook nil)
(add-hook 'gnus-apply-kill-hook
  '(lambda ()
     ;; Apply a global kill file.
     (load (gnus-newsgroup-kill-file nil) t nil t)))
@end example

  Here is an advanced example that drastically reduces the time for
applying kill files.  This hook does the kill processing directly
without loading the kill files.

@vindex gnus-nntp-server
@vindex gnus-newsgroup-name
@example
;; @r{Get rid of the default hook.}
(setq gnus-apply-kill-hook nil)
(add-hook 'gnus-apply-kill-hook
  '(lambda ()
     ;; Apply to the newsgroup `control'
     ;; if the NNTP server is flab.
     (and (string-equal gnus-nntp-server "flab")
          (string-equal gnus-newsgroup-name "control")
          (progn
            (gnus-kill "Subject" "ihave flab\\|sendme")
            (gnus-kill "Subject" "cancel\\|newgroup\\|rmgroup" "d")
            (gnus-expunge "X")))))

server name is preceded by a colon such as @samp{:Mail}, the user's
private directory @file{~/Mail} is used as a news spool.  @xref{Finding
the News}, for more information.

@vindex gnus-nntp-service
@cindex NNTP service
@item gnus-nntp-service
Specifies a service name of NNTP, usually a string @code{"nntp"}.  In a
few instances, it must be the number @code{119}.  To use a local news
spool of your machine rather than NNTP, set the variable to @code{nil}.

@vindex gnus-local-domain
@vindex DOMAINNAME
@findex system-name
@cindex domain
@item gnus-local-domain
Specifies the domain which is the domain part of your mail address
excluding the local host name of your machine.  The environment variable
@code{DOMAINNAME} is used instead if defined.  If the function
@code{system-name} returns the full Internet name, there is no need to
define the domain.

@item gnus-local-timezone

Specifies the local time zone you belong to.  The value can be either a
time zone name such as @samp{"JST"} or a difference in hour from GMT
such as @samp{+0900}.  If the variable is non-@code{nil}, a general time
zone handling package @file{timezone.el} is used to generate a valid
date for @samp{Date:} field in terms of RFC822.  Otherwise, if it is
nil, GNUS generate a date ignoring the local time zone.  If you are
using Bnews, it is okay since @file{inews} will rewrite the invalid
date.  However, if you are using Cnews or INN, you must set the variable
to the correct time zone or remove @code{Date} from the variable
@code{gnus-required-headers} since their @file{inews} do not rewrite the
wrong @samp{Date:} field.@refill

If you want to display the time of articles in your local time zone,
call the function @code{gnus-gmt-to-local} from the hook
@code{gnus-article-prepare-hook}.@refill

@vindex gnus-local-distributions

@end ignore

@vindex gnus-use-generic-path
@cindex GENERICPATH
@cindex Path field
@item gnus-use-generic-path

is used in the @samp{Path:} field as the NNTP server name instead of the
definition by the variable @code{gnus-nntp-server}.
@ignore
@xref{GENERICPATH},
for more information.
@end ignore

@vindex gnus-ignored-newsgroups
@item gnus-ignored-newsgroups

Specify a regular expression used to ignore uninterested newsgroups in
the active file.  Any lines in the active file matching this regular
expression are removed from the newsgroup list before anything else is
done to it, thus making them effectively invisible.  There is no way to
know what newsgroups there are if they are ignored.

@vindex gnus-ignored-headers
@item gnus-ignored-headers

Specifies header fields which should be ignored in an article.

@pindex Cnews
@pindex RFC977

from the variable.  If news system is Cnews, you may have to remove Date
and to add Lines.@refill

@vindex gnus-startup-file
@cindex startup file
@cindex .newsrc
@pindex Bnews
@item gnus-startup-file
Specifies a startup file of the Bnews system, usually @file{.newsrc}.
If there is a file named @file{.newsrc-@var{server}}, it is used instead

information.

@vindex gnus-signature-file
@vindex gnus-prepare-article-hook
@findex gnus-inews-insert-signature
@cindex .signature
@cindex signature
@item gnus-signature-file
Specifies a signature file of the Bnews system, usually
@file{.signature}.  The signature file is processed by the function
@code{gnus-inews-insert-signature} called from the hook
@code{gnus-prepare-article-hook} by default.  If there is a file named
@file{.signature-@var{distribution}}, it is used instead when the
distribution of the article is @var{distribution}.  Set the variable to
@code{nil} to prevent appending the signature file automatically.

@vindex gnus-use-cross-reference
@cindex cross-references
@cindex Xref field
@item gnus-use-cross-reference
Specifies what to do with cross references (@samp{Xref:} field).  If it

going to followup to an article in which @code{poster} is specified,
your confirmation is required.

@vindex gnus-use-full-window
@cindex full window
@cindex entire screen
@cindex window configuration
@item gnus-use-full-window
Non-@code{nil} means to take up the entire screen of Emacs.  If the
variable is @code{nil}, the windows used by GNUS will be restricted to
the bounds of the original window.  This is very useful if you want to
read articles while you do other work in other windows.

@vindex gnus-window-configuration
@cindex window configuration
@cindex configure windows
@item gnus-window-configuration
Specifies the configuration of the Group Mode window, the Summary Mode
window, and the Article Mode window.  The window configuration can be
specified for each action of GNUS (e.g. selecting a newsgroup or
selecting an article).  This is quite useful if you are using a slow
terminal since the update of Emacs windows can be minimized by
displaying these three windows same time.

The variable must be a list of @samp{(@var{action} (@var{g} @var{s}
@var{a}))}, where @var{action} is an action being performed, and
@var{g}, @var{s}, and @var{a} are the relative heights of the Group Mode
window, the Summary Mode window, and the Article Mode window,
respectively.  @var{action} is @code{summary}, @code{newsgroups}, or
@code{article}.

The following example is the default window configuration:

@example
(setq gnus-window-configuration
      '((summary        (0 1 0))
        (newsgroups     (1 0 0))
        (article        (0 3 10))))
@end example

The following is an example of yet another two windows mode.  Article
buffer is always displayed on a screen.  This is useful on a slow
terminal.

@example
(setq gnus-window-configuration
      '((summary        (0 1 0))
        (newsgroups     (1 0 3))
        (article        (0 1 3))))
@end example

The following is an example of three windows mode.  Three buffers are
always displayed on a screen.  This is also useful on a slow terminal.

@example
(setq gnus-window-configuration
      '((summary        (1 4 0))
        (newsgroups     (1 1 3))
        (article        (1 1 3))))
@end example

@vindex gnus-large-newsgroup
@cindex large newsgroup
@item gnus-large-newsgroup
Specifies the number of the articles which indicates a large newsgroup.
If the number of articles in a newsgroup is greater than this value, the
number of articles to be selected is asked for.  If the given value
@var{n} is positive, the last @var{n} articles are selected.  If @var{n}
is negative, the first @var{n} articles are selected.  An empty string
means to select all articles.

@vindex gnus-author-copy
@vindex AUTHORCOPY
@cindex post article
@item gnus-author-copy
Specifies a file name saving a copy of an article posted using
@samp{FCC:} field.  The variable is initialized from the
@code{AUTHORCOPY} environment variable.  The specified file name is
inserted in @samp{FCC:} field, so you have a chance to change the file
name or disable saving a copy by editing this field.

@vindex gnus-author-copy-saver
@vindex gnus-inews-article-hook
@findex rmail-output
@findex gnus-inews-do-fcc
@cindex Unix mailbox
@cindex MH folder
@pindex MH
The @samp{FCC:} field is processed by the function
@code{gnus-inews-do-fcc} called from the hook
@code{gnus-inews-article-hook} by default.  Unless the first character
of the field is @code{`|'}, the article is saved to the specified file
using the function specified by the variable
@code{gnus-author-copy-saver}.  The default function @code{rmail-output}
saves in Unix mailbox format.  Instead, if the first character is
@code{`|'}, the contents of the article is send to a program specified
by the rest of the value.  For example, articles can be saved in an MH
folder by the following:

@pindex rcvstore
@example
(setq gnus-author-copy 
      "|/usr/local/lib/mh/rcvstore +Article")
@end example

@vindex gnus-author-copy-saver

function is called with @var{newsgroup}, @var{headers}, and optional
@var{last-name}.  @var{Newsgroup} is a string representing the current
newsgroup name.  @var{Headers} is a vector containing headers of the
current article.  Macros and functions accessing contents of the
@var{headers} are defined as @code{nntp-header-@var{field}} and

@findex gnus-subscribe-interactively
@item gnus-subscribe-interactively
Asks for your decision about a new newsgroup subscription, and inserts
it in hierarchical newsgroup order if it is subscribed.  Unless, it is
killed.@refill
@end table

The following two definitions illustrate how to write your favorite
subscribing method.  The following definition (is the definition of the
function gnus-subscribe-randomly) adds new newsgroup at the beginning of
newsgroups:

@findex gnus-subscribe-newsgroup
@vindex gnus-newsrc-assoc
@example
(setq gnus-subscribe-newsgroup-method
      '(lambda (newsgroup)
         (gnus-subscribe-newsgroup newsgroup
                                   (car (car gnus-newsrc-assoc)))))
@end example

Instead, if you want to add new newsgroup at the end of newsgroups, use
the following:

@findex gnus-subscribe-newsgroup
@example
(setq gnus-subscribe-newsgroup-method
      '(lambda (newsgroup)
         (gnus-subscribe-newsgroup newsgroup nil)))
@end example

@kindex U (Group Mode)
@findex gnus-group-unsubscribe-group
If you want to prevent adding new newsgroups automatically and want to
subscribe them later using the command @kbd{U}
(@code{gnus-group-unsubscribe-group}) in the Newsgroup buffer, use the
following:

@example
(setq gnus-subscribe-newsgroup-method
      '(lambda (newsgroup) nil))        ;Do nothing.
@end example

The following final example must be the most useful for you who want not
to add new newsgroups automatically.  This definition subscribes a new
newsgroup first, and then kills it.  The killed newsgroups can be added
to the subscription list interactively using Browse-Killed Mode
(@pxref{Maintaining Subscriptions}).

@findex gnus-subscribe-newsgroup
@findex gnus-kill-newsgroup
@example
(setq gnus-subscribe-newsgroup-method
      '(lambda (newsgroup)
         (gnus-subscribe-newsgroup newsgroup)
         (gnus-kill-newsgroup newsgroup)))

@node Hooks
@appendixsec Function Hooks

@table @code
@vindex gnus-group-mode-hook
@item gnus-group-mode-hook
Called with no arguments after initializing Group Mode if its value is
non-@code{nil}.  This hook is intended to customize Group Mode only
once.  It is possible to define or change the NNTP server as you like in
this hook since the hook is called before GNUS is connected to an NNTP
server.

@vindex gnus-summary-mode-hook
@item gnus-summary-mode-hook
Called with no arguments after initializing Summary Mode if its value is
non-@code{nil}.  This hook is intended to customize Summary Mode only
once.  All sorts of searches in Summary Mode normally ignore the case of
the text they are searching through.  If you do not want to ignore the
case, set the variable @code{case-fold-search} to @code{nil} in this
hook.

The following example shows how to assign the functions
@code{gnus-summary-next-group} and @code{gnus-summary-prev-group} to
keys in Summary Mode.

@example
(setq gnus-summary-mode-hook
      '(lambda ()
         (local-set-key "\C-cn" 'gnus-summary-next-group)
         (local-set-key "\C-cp" 'gnus-summary-prev-group)))
@end example

@vindex gnus-article-mode-hook

of GNUS according to the server.

@vindex gnus-group-prepare-hook
@item gnus-group-prepare-hook
Called with no arguments after a list of newsgroups is prepared in the
Newsgroup buffer.  This hook is intended to modify the buffer.

@vindex gnus-summary-prepare-hook
@item gnus-summary-prepare-hook
Called with no arguments after list of subjects is prepared in the
Summary buffer.  This hook is intended to modify the buffer.

@vindex gnus-article-prepare-hook
@item gnus-article-prepare-hook
Called with no arguments after an article is prepared in the Article
buffer.  This hook is intended to modify the buffer.  For example, kanji
code conversion or un-ROT13/47-ing can be done in this hook.

@vindex gnus-select-group-hook
@item gnus-select-group-hook
Called with no arguments when a newsgroup is selected.  This hook is
intended to change the behavior of GNUS according to the selected
newsgroup.

@cindex sort headers
The following is an example of sorting the headers listed in the Summary
buffer by date and then by subject.  Preceding @samp{Re:} of subjects is
ignored while comparing subjects.

@findex gnus-sort-headers
@findex gnus-date-lessp
@findex gnus-string-lessp
@findex gnus-header-date
@findex gnus-header-subject
@findex gnus-simplify-subject

        ))
@end example

@cindex simplify subjects
The following is an example of simplifying subjects like the
@code{gnus-summary-next-same-subject} command does:

@findex nntp-set-header-subject
@vindex gnus-newsgroup-headers
@example
(setq gnus-select-group-hook
      '(lambda ()
         (mapcar (function

                 gnus-newsgroup-headers)))
@end example

In some newsgroups, author names are meaningless.  It is possible to
prevent listing author names in the Summary buffer as follows:

@vindex gnus-optional-headers
@vindex gnus-newsgroup-name
@findex gnus-optional-lines
@findex gnus-optional-lines-and-from
@example
(setq gnus-select-group-hook

         (cond ((string-equal "comp.sources.unix"
                              gnus-newsgroup-name)
                (setq gnus-optional-headers
                      (function gnus-optional-lines)))
               (t
                (setq gnus-optional-headers
                      (function
                         gnus-optional-lines-and-from))))))
@end example

@vindex gnus-select-article-hook
@item gnus-select-article-hook
Called with no arguments when an article is selected if its value is
non-@code{nil}.

@findex gnus-summary-show-thread
The default hook definition shows conversation thread subtrees of the
selected article automatically as follows:

@example
(setq gnus-select-article-hook
      '(lambda ()
         (gnus-summary-show-thread)))
@end example

It is possible to run Rmail on a digest article automatically as
follows:

@vindex gnus-newsgroup-name
@vindex gnus-current-headers
@example
(setq gnus-select-article-hook
      '(lambda ()
         (gnus-summary-show-thread)
         (cond ((string-equal "comp.sys.sun"
                              gnus-newsgroup-name)
                (gnus-summary-rmail-digest))
               ((and (string-equal "comp.text"
                                   gnus-newsgroup-name)
                     (string-match "^TeXhax Digest"
                                   (gnus-header-subject

                (gnus-summary-rmail-digest)
                ))))
@end example

@vindex gnus-select-digest-hook
@item gnus-select-digest-hook
Called with no arguments when reading digest messages using Rmail if its
value is non-@code{nil}.  This hook is intended to modify an article so
that Rmail can work with it.  @xref{Digest Articles}, for more
information on digest articles.

The following example is the default hook definition to modify
incomplete digest articles:

@findex gnus-fetch-field
@example
(setq gnus-select-digest-hook
      '(lambda ()
         ;; Reply-To: is required by
         ;; `undigestify-rmail-message'.
         (or (mail-position-on-field "Reply-to" t)
             (progn
               (mail-position-on-field "Reply-to")
               (insert (gnus-fetch-field "From"))))))
@end example

@vindex gnus-rmail-digest-hook
@item gnus-rmail-digest-hook
Called with no arguments when reading digest messages using Rmail if its
value is non-@code{nil}.  This hook is intended to customize Rmail Mode
for reading digest articles.

@vindex gnus-apply-kill-hook
@item gnus-apply-kill-hook
Called with no arguments when a newsgroup is selected and the Summary
buffer is prepared if its value is non-@code{nil}.  This hook is intended
to apply kill files to the selected newsgroup.  It is set to the
function @code{gnus-apply-kill-file} by default.

Since a general kill file is too heavy to use only for a few newsgroups,
a lighter hook function is recommended.  For example, if you'd like to
apply kills to articles which contain the string @samp{rmgroup} in
subject in newsgroup @samp{control}, you can use the following
hook:

@findex gnus-kill
@vindex gnus-newsgroup-name
@example
(setq gnus-apply-kill-hook
      '(lambda ()
         (cond ((string-match "control" gnus-newsgroup-name)
                (gnus-kill "Subject" "rmgroup")
                (gnus-expunge "X")))))
@end example

@xref{Kill File}, for more information on kill files.

@vindex gnus-mark-article-hook
@item gnus-mark-article-hook
Called with no arguments when an article is selected for the first time
if its value is non-@code{nil}.  The hook is intended to mark an article
as read (or saved) automatically when it is selected.

The following example is the default definition of the hook:

@vindex gnus-current-article
@vindex gnus-newsgroup-marked
@findex gnus-summary-mark-as-read
@findex gnus-summary-set-current-mark
@example
(setq gnus-mark-article-hook
      '(lambda ()
         ;; Mark the selected article as read.
         (or (memq gnus-current-article gnus-newsgroup-marked)
             (gnus-summary-mark-as-read gnus-current-article))
         ;; Put "+" on the current subject.
         (gnus-summary-set-current-mark "+")
         ))
@end example

It is possible to mark as saved (@samp{-}) instead when an article is
selected as follows:

@findex gnus-summary-mark-as-unread
@findex gnus-summary-set-current-mark
@example
(setq gnus-mark-article-hook
      '(lambda ()
         ;; Mark the selected article as saved.
         (gnus-summary-mark-as-unread gnus-current-article)
         ;; Put "+" on the current subject.
         (gnus-summary-set-current-mark "+")
         ))
@end example

@vindex gnus-prepare-article-hook
@item gnus-prepare-article-hook
@cindex signature
@findex gnus-inews-insert-signature
Called with no arguments after preparing message body, but before
preparing header fields which is automatically generated if its value is
non-@code{nil}.  Text changes made by this hook does not affect on the
editing text.  The default hook inserts a signature file by calling the
function @code{gnus-inews-insert-signature}.@refill

@vindex gnus-inews-article-hook
@item gnus-inews-article-hook
@pindex inews
@findex gnus-inews-do-fcc
Called with no arguments before posting an article if its value is
non-@code{nil}.  This hook is called just before sending an article to
the NNTP server or calling the @file{inews} program.  Text changes made
by this hook does not affect on the editing text.  It is no recommended
to alter the number of lines of the article since @samp{Lines:} field
may be already there.  The default hook does FCC (save an article to the
specified file) by calling the function @code{gnus-inews-do-fcc}.@refill

@vindex gnus-exit-group-hook
@item gnus-exit-group-hook
@vindex gnus-newsgroup-headers
Called with no arguments when exiting the current newsgroup if its value
is non-@code{nil}.  If your machine is so slow that exiting from Summary
Mode takes a long time, you can inhibit marking articles as read by
using cross-reference information in the @samp{Xref:} field by setting
the variable @code{gnus-newsgroup-headers} to @code{nil} in this
hook.

@vindex gnus-exit-gnus-hook
@item gnus-exit-gnus-hook
Called with no arguments when exiting GNUS if its value is
non-@code{nil}.  If you want to clear out Emacs buffers which were
created by GNUS and remain afterwards, you can use this hook.

The following example shows how to kill a buffer which was used for
posting news.

@example
(setq gnus-exit-gnus-hook
      '(lambda ()
         ;; Kill a buffer used for posting news.
         (and (get-buffer "*post-news*")
              (kill-buffer "*post-news*"))))
@end example

@vindex gnus-suspend-gnus-hook
@item gnus-suspend-gnus-hook
Called with no arguments when suspending GNUS if its value is
non-@code{nil}.  The purpose is the same as the hook
@code{gnus-exit-gnus-hook}.

@vindex gnus-save-newsrc-hook
@item gnus-save-newsrc-hook
Called with no arguments before saving the startup file @file{.newsrc}
if its value is non-@code{nil}.  This hook is intended to change the way
of backing up the startup file.

@chapter Troubleshooting GNUS

@vindex nntp-buggy-select
  Emacs may hang up while waiting for NNTP server responses.  This may
be caused by a buggy select routine of your operating system.  If so,
the problem may be solved by loading the source code for the library
@file{nntp.el} instead of running the byte-compiled version.  If you
still have problems with it, set the variable @code{nntp-buggy-select}
to @code{t}.

@vindex nntp-maximum-request
  Emacs may hang up while retrieving headers of a large newsgroup.  The
reason is that too many requests have been sent to the NNTP server
without reading replies to them.  This causes a deadlock of Emacs and
the server.  In this case, the number of requests sent to the server at
one time must be reduced.  Set the variable @code{nntp-maximum-request}
to a lower value than the default.  The optimal value depends on your
computing environment.

@ignore
@vindex gnus-nntp-server
@vindex gnus-author-copy
@vindex gnus-article-save-directory
  Basically, GNUS is not designed to be preloaded.  For instance, if you
preload @file{gnus.el}, some user variables which are initialized from
environment variables may be improperly initialized according to your
environment definitions.  The variables @code{gnus-nntp-server},
@code{gnus-author-copy}, and @code{gnus-article-save-directory} are such
variables.

  To prevent GNUS from being initialized from your definitions, you
should @code{unsetenv} related environment variables before preloading
GNUS, or set the variables to @code{nil} after loading GNUS.

@appendixsec How to Report a Bug
@cindex report a bug
@cindex bug report

  If you find a bug, it is important to report it and to report it in a
way which is useful.  If it is a bug of a lisp program, what is the most
useful is an exact backtrace information of the lisp program together
with the version number of GNUS that you are using.

  To make the backtrace information, you must set the Emacs variable
@code{debug-on-error} to @code{t} before the error happens.  A backtrace
obtained from a byte-compiled lisp program is not usually
understandable.  To make a human readable backtrace, load the source
program which is not byte-compiled yet and then produce the
error.
