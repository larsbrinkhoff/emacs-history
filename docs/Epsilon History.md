Lugaru Software was started by two former Carnegie Mellon University
students.  We'd used TECO-based EMACS on the school's time-shared
PDP-20 systems, but it was far too large to run under DOS.

The closest DOS equivalent we knew of at the time (1983) was
[MINCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINCE), but it was built for DOS
1.0 and couldn't use directories (a feature introduced in DOS 2.0),
only drive letters.  You had to run it from the one directory with all
the files you wanted to edit.

We started developing Epsilon in December 1983, and the [first
version](https://www.lugaru.com/history.html) (for DOS) came out in
1984.  The following year, we introduced both a concurrent process
feature (adding multitasking to DOS, so you could run a compiler in a
buffer window while editing) and an extension language.
